Introduction\\nAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative dis-\\nease whose clinical manifestations are mainly memory degrada-\\ntion\\nand\\ncognitive\\nfunction\\nimpairment,\\nwhich\\nseriously\\nthreatens the quality and safety of life of the seniors (Coleman\\net al., 2017). Fig. 1 shows the brains of AD patients presented by\\ntomography. Research has suggested that the incidence rate of\\ndementia among seniors over 65 years old in European and Amer-\\nican countries is about 4–8%, while the incidence rate of dementia\\nin China is 7.8%, in which the incidence rate of AD is 4.8%\\n(Smailagic et al., 2018). As the country with the largest population\\nin the world, China is about to face the increasingly serious prob-\\nlem of population aging, and AD would bring enormous economic\\nand living burdens to patients, families, and the society (Oliveira\\net al., 2018).\\nBased on the malignant degradation of cognitive and physical\\nfunctions of patients, clinically, AD is divided into 3 stages, i.e.\\nthe pre-clinical stage, the mild cognitive function impairment\\nstage, and the dementia stage (Jiang et al., 2018). In the pre-\\nclinical stage, the early pathological onset of the disease begins\\nin the cerebral cortex, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), and blood circula-\\ntion of the patient; however, no signiﬁcant clinical manifestations\\nare observed, as shown in Fig. 2. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\\nis a transitional stage between normal aging and the progression to\\nAD. The thinking ability and memory of MCI patients are degraded\\nmildly, which would affect the daily communication of MCI\\npatients (Ma et al., 2018). A survey has suggested that about\\n10–15% MCI patients are progressed to AD annually, while the\\ntransformation rate of AD among normal seniors is only 1–2%; in\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2019.12.004\\n1319-562X/� 2019 The Author(s).

Thus, it is seen that MCI is more\\nlikely to be further developed into AD, which can be used as a\\nkey breakthrough in the early diagnosis of AD.\\nAt present, the clinical examination methods of AD mainly\\ninclude cerebrospinal ﬂuid examination, electroencephalogram\\nexamination,\\nneuropsychological\\nexamination,\\nneuroimaging\\nexamination, and the latest genetic detection and molecular probe\\ndetection. Neuroimaging is widely used in the ﬁeld of assisted\\ndiagnosis for the cerebral disease. It can provide rich information\\nabout brain structure or brain functions and help researchers ana-\\nlyze the conditions of patients from various angles, making the\\nearly diagnosis of cerebral disease possible (Ferreira et al., 2017).\\nTherefore, MCI is an important point of penetration for the early\\ndiagnosis and prevention of AD. Based on the deep learning net-\\nwork model, a risk prediction model of AD was proposed in the\\nresearch to predict the transformation of AD from MCI in advance,\\nthereby effectively reducing the incidence rate of AD. Due to the\\ndifference in the types of data structures and the degrees of com-\\nplexity, the prediction effects obtained by different prediction\\nmodels applied to different ﬁelds are also different. According to\\nthe information obtained in the previous documents, the widely\\nused prediction models in the imaging ﬁeld include the support\\nvector machine and Lasso. The texture data of medical images have\\nstrong self-characteristics, including large data dimensions, large\\ndata variables, and a certain weak correlation between variables.\\nTo improve the risk prediction rate of AD, this study will further\\nexplore the key aspects of AD risk prediction based on the theoret-\\nical basis of deep learning and the 18F-FDG PET image data of the\\nbrain.\\n2. Materials and methods\\nA total of 350 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants\\nfrom the ADNI database were selected as the research objects; in\\naddition, the CAFFE was selected as the framework of the deep\\nlearning platform, the FDG PET image features of each participant\\nwere extracted by a deep convolution network model; then, a risk\\nprediction model of AD was constructed to predict the transforma-\\ntion of AD from MCI in the hope of reducing the incidence rate of\\nAD.\\n2.1. ADNI and research objects\\nThe Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a\\nglobal longitudinal multi-site observational study based on various\\napproaches such as comprehensive neuroimaging examinations,\\nassays of CSF and blood biomarkers, and clinical cognitive function\\nassessments, which aims to identify AD at an earlier stage and pro-\\nvide evidence for early diagnosis and treatment of AD.\\nResearch carried out in the ADNI database is divided into 3\\nstages, i.e. ADNI1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI2. The ﬁrst stage (ADNI1)\\nwas completed in October 2010. Completion institutions included\\na total of 57 research centers in the United States and Canada, with\\na total of 819 research objects included, in which 192 cases were\\nAD patients, 398 cases were mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\\npatients and 229 were normal aging populations. Fig. 3 compares\\nthe brain scans between healthy people and AD patients.\\nAfter the completion of the ﬁrst stage ADNI1, a two-year study\\nwas continued, which became the second stage ADNI-GO, with\\nnew patients added. The third stage is the ADNI2 stage. The respec-\\ntive inclusion criteria of each group in the ADNI-GO and ADNI2\\nstages are as follows:\\nThe normal control group (NC): The score of Mini-Mental State\\nExamination (MMSE) is between 24 and 30 points, and the Clinical\\nDementia Rating (CDR) score is 0 points; in order to avoid the\\npotential incidence risks of AD or MCI among the objects in the\\ngroup, all the objects should be 70-year-old seniors. The tracking\\nacquisition time is 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.\\nThe EMCI group: The MMSE score (Liu et al., 2018) is between\\n24 and 30 points, with complaints of memory impairment; in\\nterms of the scores obtained from the Logical Memory Assessment\\nScale in the Delayed Memory Scale (Rondina et al., 2018), the one\\nwhose education years exceed 16 years would get 9–11 points, the\\none whose education years are 8–15 years would get 5–9 points,\\nand the one whose education years are 0–7 years would get 3–6\\npoints, the CDR score is 0.5, the patient could take care of\\nFig. 1.

The tracking acquisition time of newly included objects in\\nADNI-GO is 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. The tracking acquisition time\\nof newly included objects in ADNI2 is 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.\\nThe LMCI group: The difference from EMCI is that it compares\\nthe degree of education with the loss of objective memory; the\\none whose education years exceed 16 years would get a maximum\\nof 8 points, the one whose education years are 8–15 years would\\nget 5–9 points, and the one whose education years are 0–7 years\\nwould get 3–6 points, and the other assessment criteria are the\\nsame as that of the EMCI group.\\nIn the research, a total of 350 MCI participants from the ADNI\\ndatabase were selected as the research objects to analyze their\\nFDG positron emission tomography (PET) images. Based on the\\nresearch needs and the follow-up records of the ADNI, all the\\n350 MCI participants were divided into MCIc and MCInc; informa-\\ntion of the participant is summarized in Table 1.\\n2.2. Deep learning framework\\nBased on actual needs, the CAFFE was selected as the frame-\\nwork of the deep learning platform. CAFFE was implemented in\\nC++ language and had Python and Matlab interfaces; it could\\nquickly realize the convolution neural network (CNN) on GPU\\nand conveniently convert between GPU and CPU. CAFFE had visual\\ninterfaces in the Linux operating environment, which provided a\\nrelatively sophisticated tool for the visualization of the deep\\nnetwork.\\nThe 3 basic results of the CAFFE framework were Blobs, Layers,\\nand Nets. The function of Blobs was to store and distribute various\\ndata; common Blobs were 4D vectors, including the ‘‘Number” that\\nrepresented the number of images and the ‘‘Channel” that repre-\\nsented the color channels of images, where the channel of the\\ngrayscale image was 1 and the channel of the 3-channel RGB was\\n3; in addition, ‘‘Height” and ‘‘Width” were used to indicate the\\nheights and widths of images respectively (Purandare et al., 2017).\\nIn the implementation process, CAFFE generally included the\\nnetwork layer and the pooling layer; the ‘‘Layers” are the basis\\nfor the realization of functions of various layers, which generally\\nincluded 3 steps, i.e. the construction of layers, the forward propa-\\ngation, and the back-propagation (BP). ‘‘Nets” generally consisted\\nof multiple layers, which deﬁned the entire network results as\\ninput and output, etc.; it was the integration of multiple ‘‘Layer”\\nlayers to form a complete network result. The operating principles\\nof the CAFFE framework are illustrated in Fig. 4.\\n2.3. Deep convolution network model and AlexNet\\nIn the research, the CNN network structure was trained by the\\ncombination of neural cognitive machine and BP algorithm; the\\nLeNet-5 model was used as the deep convolution network model;\\nthe network structure was illustrated in Fig. 5.\\nThe general network structure of a convolution neural network\\n(CNN) consists of an input layer, a convolution layer, a pooling\\nlayer, a full connected layer, and an output layer (Inui et al., 2017).\\nUsually, each convolution layer was composed of several fea-\\nture surfaces, and each feature surface had plenty neurons, which\\nwere locally connected to the input to extract the local features;\\nmeanwhile, each feature surface was interconnected and affected\\nthe relations with other feature spaces, and multiple feature maps\\nwould form new feature surfaces.\\nIn the process of convolution calculation, the convolution kernel\\nwas connected to a local region of the feature map, which was\\ncalled the local receptive ﬁeld. The weight of the convolution ker-\\nnel shared by the entire feature map was called weight sharing.\\nThe convolution-calculated feature maps could be expressed\\nthrough Eq. (1):\\nXl\\nj ¼ f\\nX\\ni2Mj\\nXl�1\\ni\\n� k\\nl\\nij þ b\\ni\\nj\\n0\\n@\\n1\\nA\\nð1Þ\\nThe output of the convolution layer was permitted by locally\\nweighting and transferring to a nonlinear activation function (such\\nas Sigmoid). Currently, the activation functions could be roughly\\ndivided into Sigmoid functions and non-Sigmoid functions, the\\nLeNet-5 used Sigmoid functions, which was expressed as Eq. (2)\\nf x\\nð Þ ¼\\n1\\n1 þ ex\\nð2Þ\\nGenerally, the convolution layer was closely followed by the\\npooling layer, which was also composed of several feature surfaces,\\nand each feature surface shared a unique correspondence relation-\\nship with the feature surface of the convolution layer; in addition,\\nthe pooling layer also had the features of weight sharing and local\\nconnection, and the main function was to reduce the dimensional-\\nity of images while preserving the original feature information of\\nimages, thereby the number of parameters during network training\\nwas reduced. The network after dimensionality reduction not only\\nreduced the computational complexity and the complexity of the\\nhidden layer but also made it easier to classify. The general form\\nof pooling was expressed by Eq. (3);\\nXl\\nj ¼ f wl\\njdownðXðl�1Þ\\nj\\nÞ þ b\\ni\\nj\\n�\\n�\\nð3Þ\\nThe pooling methods adopted in the research were max pooling\\nand average pooling. The pooling process was similar to the convo-\\nlution process, which moved in the order of from the top to the\\nbottom and from the left to the right. Max Pooling found the max-\\nimum value of the covered window as an element of the output\\nfeature map; Average Pooling found the average value of the cov-\\nered window as an element of the output feature map. Pooling\\nwas important for processing images with different sizes in actual\\nproblems; since the classiﬁcation layer must be uniformly ﬁxed,\\nthe image size could be uniﬁed by adjusting the paranoid size of\\nthe pooling layer.\\nTable 1\\nInformation on research objects.\\nMCIc\\nMCInc\\nTotal number\\n70\\n280\\nGender (male/female)\\n32/38\\n143/137\\nAge (yr)\\n71.7 ± 5.8\\n72.0 ± 5.9\\nEducational level\\n16.0 ± 2.4\\n16.3 ± 2.6\\nMMSE\\n27.1 ± 1.7\\n27.8 ± 1.5\\nFig. 4.

Liu / Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 27 (2020) 659–665\\n661\\nThe network structure of AlexNet included 8 layers of neural\\nnetworks, 5 convolution layers, and 3 full connected layers. Given\\nthe enormous data and network scale, it was necessary to put for-\\nward higher requirements for GPU video memory; therefore, the\\nAlexNet selected 2 GTX580 GPUs in parallel, and the video memory\\nof each GPU was 3 GB. The activation function of AlexNet was Rec-\\ntiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), which was expressed through Eq. (4):\\nf x\\nð Þ ¼ max 0; x\\nð\\nÞ\\nð4Þ\\nCompared with the saturated nonlinear activation functions\\nsuch as Sigmoid and tanh, ReLU not only solved the problems of\\ngradient explosion and disappearance but also greatly improved\\nthe convergence speed. The image of ReLU function was illustrated\\nin Fig. 6. In the dataset of Cifar-10, once the error rate of the con-\\nvolution of the 4th layer in AlexNet reduced to 25%, the conver-\\ngence\\nspeed\\nof\\nReLU\\nwas\\nnearly\\n6\\ntimes\\nfaster\\nthan\\nthe\\nconvergence speed of f x\\nð Þ ¼ tanh x\\nð Þ\\nj\\nj, which showed that ReLU\\ngreatly improved the learning efﬁciency.\\n2.4. Image data processing based on CAFFE and AlexNet\\nThe obtained image data were preprocessed; the detailed pro-\\ncessing steps were as follows:\\nThe PET images in the ADNI database were collected by using\\nthe PET scanners manufactured by General Electric (GE), Siemens,\\nand Philips. Before the image collection, researchers should con-\\nﬁrm that all participants had none of the following contraindica-\\ntions: (1) unable to complete the experiment (claustrophobia,\\netc.); (2) unable to lie on the scanning bed for 45 min (non-\\nquantitative study) or 75 min (quantitative study); (3) unable to\\nbe injected with tracers through venous accesses. Participants\\nwho were scanned in the morning should fast until the scans were\\ncompleted (with free access to water); participants who were\\nscanned in the afternoon should fast for more than 4 h. The correct\\npositioning of participants was a critical step to complete the PET\\nscans; in addition, it was necessary to ensure the accuracy of the\\npositions and the comfort of the participants. Besides, participants\\nshould leave their personal belongings out of the scan room, such\\nas wallets, keys, glasses, necklaces, earrings, and hearing aids, etc.\\nAdditional mats were placed under the neck of the participant to\\nprovide adequate support. A laser was used to ensure no rotations\\nin each plane. The head of the participant should be approximately\\nparallel to the imaginary line between the outer corner of the eye\\nand the outer ear canal. Supporting devices were provided for the\\nback and lower limb areas. In the quantitative study, it would be\\nbetter to place a small table at the edge of the scanning bed for tra-\\ncer management and venous blood draw, as well as for the partic-\\nipant to rest. In addition, an emergency button should be provided\\nto the participant, or a researcher was required to accompany the\\nparticipant to ensure the safety of the experiment. Environmental\\nstandardization was essential within 20–30 min after the injection\\nof 5 + 0.5 mCi (185 MBq) of the 18F-FDG tracer. During the tracer\\ningestion stage, participants should remain still and awake, with\\ntheir eyes widely opened and looked straight ahead. The lights\\nshould be dim remained unchanged throughout the overall acqui-\\nsition process. The participants were checked regularly to ensure\\ntheir eyes were open and they were conscious.\\nThe grid of voxel image re-sampled by the baseline PET image\\nregistration averaged image of each participant was oriented such\\nthat the front and rear axes of the participant were parallel to the\\nAC-PC line. Afterward, feature extraction was performed to the\\npreprocessed FEG-PET images. Feature extraction was an impor-\\ntant step in the study of classiﬁcation problems, which directly\\nrelated to the results of classiﬁcation. The feature extraction of\\ngeneral FDG PET images was mainly for the images themselves,\\nincluding the voxel or the metabolic intensity of the brain region.\\nIn addition, the histogram and the gray level concurrence matrix\\n(GLCM) of the gradient and direction were extracted from FDG\\nPET images as the features in some studies. After data preprocess-\\ning, the dimension of the gray matter density map of each partici-\\npant became 121 � 145 � 121, and the voxel size became a gray\\nmatter image of 1.5 � 1.5 � 1.5 mm3; however, the application\\nof AlexNet migration learning needed to satisfy the RGB 3-\\nchannel colored images whose sides were the same as those of\\nthe input images; therefore, the pre-processed gray matter images\\nshould be converted before the features were extracted by using\\nthe migration learning method.\\nThe image processing steps in the stage were implemented in\\nthe Windows 7 operating system by using the NifTi_2014 toolkit\\nloaded by MRIcro software and Matlab 2015b; the ﬁrst 3 steps\\nwere an interpolation, completion, and segmentation. After the\\n3rd step was output, the NifTi image of each participant was seg-\\nFig. 5. Convolution process of LeNet-5.\\nFig. 6. The schematic diagram of ReLU function.\\n662\\nZ. Yang, Z. Liu / Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 27 (2020) 659–665\\nmented averagely from the Z-axis into 65 images in PNG format.\\nFinally, all the grayscale images in the PNG format were converted\\ninto pseudo-colored images in the RGB format. The parameter vari-\\nations of the above-mentioned image conversion dimensions and\\nvoxels were summarized in Table 2.\\nAfter the data were prepared, all the images were transformed\\ninto Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) format. The fea-\\nture extraction process used the pre-trained CAFFE model, which\\nrequired to customize the primary input parameters such as the\\nsize of the network; afterward, the different layers were selected\\nbased on to the network structure to extract features respectively;\\nin addition, the features were extracted into LMDB format. After\\nthe features were extracted, based on the output parameters of\\neach layer in the network model, the feature rows were visualized.\\nAccording to the principle of feature migration, each prepro-\\ncessed brain image was visualized in the feature extraction of con-\\nv1, conv3, conv4, and conv5 of AlexNet, respectively. In the\\nresearch, the features of conv3, conv4, and conv5 were extracted,\\nand the features of the LMDB format were changed into feature\\nmatrices for subsequent classiﬁcation and prediction. Taking conv3\\nas an example, according to the model parameters of AlexNet, the\\nimage of each participant became data in 65 � 64,896 dimensions,\\nof which 64,896 was the output of conv3 13 � 13 � 384; however,\\nin terms of the next step of classiﬁcation, the image of each partic-\\nipant\\nwas\\nrecombined\\nin\\n3D,\\nand\\nthe\\ndimensions\\nreached\\n4,218,240, which was undoubtedly a dimensional disaster for the\\nclassiﬁer; therefore, the features of each participant were submit-\\nted to dimension reduction by overlapping polling, in which the\\nstep was 2, the size of pooling window was 3, i.e. S = 2, Z=; then,\\nthe conv3 and conv4 feature dimensions of each participant\\nbecame 1 � 898,560, and the conv5 feature dimension of each par-\\nticipant became 1 � 599,040.\\n2.5. Model construction of prediction and classiﬁcation\\nThe basic construction ﬂow of the classiﬁcation and prediction\\nmodel was illustrated in Fig. 7. During the image preprocessing\\nprocess, the original FDG PET image was converted into NifTi for-\\nmat, and the gray matter was extracted to generate the gray matter\\ndensity map; after the completion and segmentation, the image\\nwas converted to ﬁt the input size of AlexNet; next, the image\\nwas converted into 2D image in PNG format, which was then con-\\nverted into the LMDB format that CAFFE could recognize. During\\nthe\\nAlexNet-based\\nfeature\\nextraction\\nprocess,\\nfeatures\\nwere\\nsequentially extracted by setting input sizes and input batches that\\nmet the experimental requirements and the video memory. After-\\nward, the predictive model for MCIc and MCInc was constructed,\\nand a feature classiﬁcation set for the classiﬁcation models of EMCI\\nand LMCI was established. The PCA was input for dimension reduc-\\ntion; the training set was selected by using the SFS algorithm, and a\\ntotal of 20 most representative features of the training set were\\nselected. Since only 70 cases of MCIc were included, 40 cases were\\nselected as the training sets in the prediction model. Finally, the\\nselected features were input into the classiﬁer as the test set to\\nobtain the ﬁnal classiﬁcation results.\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Brain PET images of MCI participants\\nAfter the tracer was ingested, the brains of the MCI participants\\nwere scanned with PET and were compared with the brain PET\\nscans of the healthy participants. As shown in Fig. 8, compared\\nwith the healthy human brain, the brains of MCI participants began\\nto shrink, and part of the nervous system functions would gradu-\\nally degenerate.\\n3.2.

In addition to the time limit of the\\nresearch, only 70 cases of MCIc were selected from ADNI-GO and\\nADNI-2; if the transformation prediction was performed, the\\namount of data in each group may be smaller, which would lead\\nto more uneven data and eventually affected the classiﬁer to a\\nlarge extent.\\n3.3.

Conclusion\\nThe positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced nuclear\\nmedicine functional imaging technology used to observe metabolic\\nprocesses in vivo to help clinicians diagnose diseases. A total of 350\\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants from the ADNI data-\\nbase were selected as the research objects; in addition, the CAFFE\\nwas selected as the framework of the deep learning platform, the\\nFDG PET image features of each participant were extracted by a\\ndeep convolution network model. Then, a prediction and classiﬁca-\\ntion model of AD was constructed and was applied to the MCI\\nstage, which achieved preferable classiﬁcation and transformation\\nprediction results.\\nThe risk prediction of AD based on the deep learning model of\\nbrain 18F-FDG PET discussed in the research matched the expected\\nresults, which achieved preferable predictive results in the prob-\\nlem of MCI transformation. According to the prediction results,\\nthe classiﬁcation of conv3 achieved good results in MCI transfor-\\nmation prediction, and the sensitivity and speciﬁcity were respec-\\ntively 91.02% and 77.63%, indicating that the model constructed in\\nthis study can be used in the MCI transformation. In addition, by\\nusing the whole-brain gray matter feature as the material for fea-\\nture extraction, 72.19% of accuracy was obtained in the classiﬁca-\\ntion problem of LMCI and EMCI in the conv5 layer, and the\\nsensitivity and speciﬁcity were also about 73%, indicating that\\nthe classiﬁcation model was effective for the classiﬁcation of EMCI\\nand LMCI. It provided a relatively accurate reference model for the\\nprediction of AD. However, certain deﬁciencies were found in the\\nresearch process, such as the limited database data, which led to\\nthe results that the accuracy of the constructed model was not\\nwell-veriﬁed. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the data capac-\\nity to further explore the accuracy of the AD risk prediction model\\nin subsequent research.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis study was funded by a grant from the National Natural\\nScience Foundation of China (Project No. 81871465).\\nReferences\\nColeman, R.A., Liang, C., Patel, R., et al., 2017.

They appear\\nto be better at prediction and classification in biological systems than do traditional strategies such as\\nlogistic regression. This paper provides a practical example that contrasts both approaches within the\\nsetting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room.\\nMethods The study population comprised patients with suspected bacterial infection as their main\\ndiagnosis for admission to the emergency room at two University-based hospitals. Mortality within the\\nfirst 28 days from admission was predicted using logistic regression with the following variables: age,\\nimmunosuppressive systemic disease, general systemic disease, Shock Index, temperature, respiratory\\nrate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, leucocyte counts, platelet counts and creatinine. Also, with the same\\ninput and output variables, a probabilistic neural network was trained with an adaptive genetic\\nalgorithm. The network had three neurone layers: 10 neurones in the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer\\nand two in the output layer. Calibration was measured using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit\\ntest and discrimination was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves.\\nResults A total of 533 patients were recruited and overall 28-day mortality was 19%. The factors\\nchosen by logistic regression (with their score in parentheses) were as follows: immunosuppressive\\nsystemic disease or general systemic disease (2), respiratory rate 24–33 breaths/min (1), respiratory\\nrate ≥ 34 breaths/min (3), Glasgow Come Scale score ≤12 (3), Shock Index ≥ 1.5 (2) and temperature\\n&lt;38°C (2). The network included all variables and there were no significant differences in predictive\\nability between the approaches. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were\\n0.7517 and 0.8782 for the logistic model and the neural network, respectively (P = 0.037).\\nConclusion A predictive model would be an extremely useful tool in the setting of suspected sepsis in\\nthe emergency room. It could serve both as a guideline in medical decision-making and as a simple way\\nto select or stratify patients in clinical research.

Despite new and\\ncomplex therapies, the incidence of sepsis has increased\\nannually at a constant rate over the past 20 years, and there\\nhave been no substantial changes in the associated mortality\\n[2].\\nA tool that could stratify the severity of sepsis from the initial\\nstages in the clinical course would enhance our understanding\\nof this disorder and its management. A simple system\\ndesigned to estimate the probability of death would represent\\nthe basis for improved diagnosis, prognostication and treat-\\nment. Specifically, such a model, in the setting of the emer-\\ngency room (ER), could guide decisions regarding ICU\\nadmission or whether a particular type of therapy should be\\ninstituted. The strategy may be developed from the definitions\\nproposed by the American College of Chest Physicians/Soci-\\nety of Critical Care Medicine in 1992 [3]. These definitions\\ninclude a generalized process with clinical findings that may\\nrepresent an initial phase during the sepsis phenomenon – the\\nsystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although\\nthe natural history seems to reflect a continuum through differ-\\nent stages of an inflammatory response, from SIRS to septic\\nshock [4], an unequivocal linear sequence of events is far from\\nclinically apparent. Thus, classical analytical models, such as\\nlogistic regression, are limited in terms of their ability to eluci-\\ndate the interplay that underlies the sepsis phenomenon.\\nAdvances in statistical methods have supplied the tools nec-\\nessary to model complex nonlinear relationships among many\\nvariables relevant to biological systems. Artificial neural net-\\nworks (ANNs) are computer programs that simulate some of\\nthe higher level functions of the human brain. As in the brain,\\nthere are neurones and synapses, with various synaptic con-\\nnection strengths – called 'weights' – for each connected pair\\nof neurones. However, unlike the brain but similar to many\\ncomputer programs, there is a specific set of input and output\\nneurones for each problem and each net. These input and out-\\nput neurones correspond to the inputs to and outputs from a\\ntraditional computer program. The other, termed 'hidden' neu-\\nrones, along with the synapses and weights, correspond to the\\ninstructions in a traditional program. Use of ANNs as clinical\\nprediction models has been explored in many areas of medi-\\ncine, including nephrology [5], microbiology [6], radiology [7]\\nand neurology [8]. Thus far, however, we are unaware of their\\nuse in sepsis. In this study we present a practical example that\\ncontrasts the abilities of logistic regression and neural net-\\nworks to predict death in patients admitted to the ER with sus-\\npected sepsis as their main cause of hospitalization.\\nMaterials and methods\\nStudy design\\nIn this longitudinal cohort study, patients were recruited\\nbetween August 1998 and March 1999. Starting from admis-\\nsion to the ER, the patients were followed for 28 days or until\\ndeath.\\nSetting\\nThe patients were admitted to the ERs of two reference hospi-\\ntals: the Hospital Universitario San Vicente de Paúl and the\\nHospital General de Medellín. Hospital Universitario San Vice-\\nnte de Paúl is a 550-bed, fourth level university hospital, and is\\na referral centre for a region including approximately 3 million\\nhabitants. Hospital General de Medellín is a 300-bed, third\\nlevel teaching hospital, and is a referral centre for the metro-\\npolitan area. Both are located in Medellín, Colombia.\\nParticipants\\nWe included patients aged 15 years or older with any sus-\\npected or confirmed bacterial infection as their admission\\ndiagnosis and at least one of the following SIRS criteria: tem-\\nperature &gt;38°C or &lt;36°C; and leucocyte count &gt;12000/\\nmm3, &lt;4000/mm3, or &gt;10% immature forms (bands). We\\nexcluded eligible participants if they, their relatives, or their\\ndoctors refused to provide consent to participate in the study,\\nor if they died or were discharged before 24 hours. Ethics\\ncommittees of both hospitals had previously approved the pro-\\ntocol, and patients or their legal representatives signed an\\ninformed consent form.\\nMeasurements\\nThe primary outcome variable was mortality within the first 28\\ndays after admission to the ER. For those patients who were\\ndischarged before day 28, an evaluation of their vital status\\nwas conducted in the outpatient control centre or by phone if\\na personal interview was not possible. Independent variables\\nrecorded at admission were as follows: age, immunosuppres-\\nsive systemic disease (ISD; i.e. any of cancer, chemotherapy,\\nsteroid use or AIDS), general systemic disease (GSD; i.e. any\\nof cardiac failure, diabetes, renal failure, chronic obstructive\\nlung disease, or cirrhosis), Shock Index (heart rate/systolic\\narterial pressure), body temperature, respiratory rate, Glasgow\\nComa Scale (GCS) score, leucocyte count, platelet count and\\ncreatinine blood level. Research assistants in the ER collected\\nclinical variables at admission in a standardized manner. Lab-\\noratory variables were analyzed using standard quality control\\nprocedures at the participating institutions. Missing data for\\ncontinuous variables were estimated with simple imputations\\nusing the median nonmissing value. In total, estimation proce-\\ndures were performed in 2.6% (14 simple records) of baseline\\nvalues.\\nData analysis and management\\nThe procedure for the logistic model has been described in\\ndetail elsewhere [9]. Briefly, we conducted univariate logistic\\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/9/2/R150\\nR152\\nregression analysis for each candidate variable, with P &lt; 0.25\\nbeing the criterion for acceptance in the model. Collinearity\\nwas checked with a matrix of correlations, using the Spearman\\nrank correlation coefficient between independent variables.\\nWe chose a conservative strategy, with r ≥ 0.4 in at least one\\ncorrelation as the criterion for multicollinearity. Logistic model\\nassumptions (i.e. no interaction terms and a linear relationship\\nbetween the logit and the continuous covariates) were veri-\\nfied. Then, a logistic regression analysis, employing a forward\\nstepwise inclusion method, was developed using a P value of\\n0.05 at entry. This automatic procedure was contrasted with a\\nbackward elimination method and with a full model that\\nincluded all of the candidate variables, in order to confirm the\\nvalidity and stability of our results. For continuous variables,\\nthe cutoff points for changes in the probability of death were\\nexplored with locally weighted regression analysis and the\\nlowess procedure [10]. According to the cutoff points\\ndetected, dummy variables were constructed and a new logis-\\ntic regression model was fitted with those variables. In order to\\nobtain the simplest score with the same scale within and\\nbetween ranges of physiological variables and co-morbid con-\\nditions, the regression coefficients were all divided by the low-\\nest one, and then rounded off to the nearest whole number, as\\nthe weight reflecting 'risk' for death for each variable. In defin-\\ning the severity levels by the size of the coefficients, compara-\\nble severity levels within variables or conditions were grouped\\ntogether. The global score for every patient in the cohort was\\ncalculated and a new logistic regression equation with the\\nscore as independent variable was fitted.\\nThe model calibration – observed mortality versus that pre-\\ndicted with the score – was evaluated using the Hosmer-\\nLemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The test result, under a χ2 dis-\\ntribution, provides a P value in which higher values (P &gt; 0.05)\\nindicate nonsignificant differences between observed and\\npredicted mortality. The discriminatory ability – the capacity of\\nthe model to separate survivors from nonsurvivors, with 1.0\\nand 0.5 meaning perfect and random discrimination, respec-\\ntively – was determined using receiver operating characteristic\\n(ROC) curve analysis. Internal validation was done with 2000\\nbootstrap replications of the model. All statistical analyses\\nwere performed with Stata Statistical Software, Release 7.0\\n(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).\\nUsing the same input and output variables, a probabilistic neu-\\nral network was trained using an adaptive genetic algorithm\\n(NeuroShell©; Ward Systems Group Inc., Frederick, MD,\\nUSA). The network has three neurone layers, with 10 neurones\\nin the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer and two in the output\\nlayer, the latter indicating death versus survival. Of the cohort\\n75% was used to train the network and 25% was used in test-\\ning. The training criterion was that 20 generations had elapsed\\nwithout changes in the minimum error. The general perform-\\nance of the neural network was evaluated using the ROC\\ncurve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The\\ndifference between the two ROC curves – logistic regression\\nand neural network – was tested using the Wilcoxon statistic\\nbased on pairwise comparisons [11].\\nResults\\nA total of 542 potentially eligible participants were admitted\\nduring the study period. Nine were excluded because of death\\n(n = 5) or discharge (n = 4) during the first 24 hours. The final\\nstudy population therefore included 533 patients, 55% (n =\\n293) of whom were male. Their age (mean ± standard devia-\\ntion) was 48 ± 21 years, and their median hospital stay was 8\\ndays (interquartile range 4–15 days). Overall 28-day mortality\\nwas 19% (n = 101), and 14% (n = 75) of the cohort was\\nadmitted to ICU.\\nThe most common diagnoses suspected at admission were\\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia (recorded in 36% of\\npatients), followed by soft tissue infection (17%), intra-abdom-\\ninal infection (12%), urinary tract infection (11%) and others\\n(11%); sepsis of undetermined source was recorded in 13%\\npatients. The major pre-existing conditions related to admis-\\nsion were trauma or surgery more than 24 hours before admis-\\nsion (21%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12%),\\ndiabetes (13%) and miscellaneous others (9%). Of the\\npatients, 45% were free of associated diseases.\\nA total of 283 (53%) out of 533 cases of clinically suspected\\nbacterial infection were microbiologically confirmed, 113 of\\nwhich (40%) grew on blood samples. The rate of positive\\nblood cultures among the total requested was 27%, and the\\nmost frequently isolated micro-organisms were Escherichia\\ncoli (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Streptococcus\\npneumoniae (13%), Staphylococcus coagulase negative\\n(13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%), Enterobacter spp. (6%),\\nEnterococcus spp. (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), non-\\nfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (3%) and others (14%).\\nAfter conducting univariate analysis for the logistic regression,\\nleucocyte count was considered ineligible for inclusion in the\\nmodel (P = 0.893). The evaluation of collinearity was carried\\nout for all variables using the Spearman correlation coefficient.\\nA significant correlation (r = 0.44) was found between age and\\nGSD (P = 0.0000). Similar correlations, but to a lesser\\ndegree, were found between age and Shock Index (r =\\n0.1453; P = 0.0008) and between age and temperature (r =\\n0.1940; P = 0.0000). Therefore, age was excluded from the\\npredictor variables. A multiple logistic regression model was\\napplied to the overall 28-day mortality, taking into account\\nGSD, ISD, Shock Index, respiratory rate, temperature, GCS\\nscore, creatinine and platelet count as predictive variables.\\nThis model allowed us to discard the latter two variables\\nbecause they were statistically nonsignificant. For the varia-\\nbles respiratory rate, temperature, Shock Index and GCS\\nscore, the cutoff points for changes in the probability of death\\nCritical Care    April 2005\\n Vol 9 No 2    Jaimes et al.\\nR153\\nwere sought by locally weighted regression. The results are\\nshown in Table 1.\\nWith the previous values, 12 dummy variables were con-\\nstructed considering the first level (1) as the reference value.\\nThese new variables, in conjunction with the two nominal vari-\\nables previously involved (GSD and ISD), were fitted in a new\\nlogistic regression model for prediction of mortality. After divid-\\ning and rounding off coefficients to the nearest whole number,\\nsome levels and variables were bound together, namely co-\\nmorbid conditions, GCS score, Shock Index and body temper-\\nature. The final meaningful variables are summarized in Table\\n2 according to their levels and relative weights.\\nIn this way the final scale of severity was a range between 0\\nand 12. With these data, the score for each patient in the\\ncohort was calculated, and a model that provides an estimate\\nof severity, defined as the probability of 28-day mortality, was\\nobtained. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test yielded\\na value of 7.54 (P = 0.5807). By ROC curve analysis for dis-\\ncriminative capacity, the area under the curve was 0.7517.\\nThe bootstrapped coefficients for 2000 replications exhibited\\nstandard errors of under 10% of those observed in the model,\\nand the values for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test\\nand the area under the ROC curve in this set were 8.96 (P =\\n0.4321) and 0.7119, respectively.\\nThe neural network included all of the independent variables.\\nTheir weight, by the smoothing factor, ranged from 2.65 for\\ntemperature to 0.34 for ISD. The Hosmer-Lemeshow good-\\nness-of-fit test yielded a value of 8.03 (P = 0.475), and the\\narea under the ROC curve was 0.8782. The difference\\nbetween ROC curves was statistically significant according to\\nthe Wilcoxon statistic based on pairwise comparisons (P =\\n0.037). Figure 1 shows the comparison of observed and pre-\\ndicted deaths with both methods.\\nDiscussion\\nThe present study shows that it is possible to obtain a simple\\nindicator of the risk for death under clinical conditions compat-\\nible with severe infections. The system uses variables taken\\nfrom the initial clinical interview and physical examination, all of\\nwhich are available at the moment of admission to the ER. This\\nsuggests that it is possible to develop a reproducible and\\ntransportable predictive instrument in patients with signs\\nindicative of sepsis. However, the model must be specifically\\ntested in an independent population with a larger sample size.\\nThe main determinants of mortality reflect two acknowledged\\nhost factors, namely co-morbid conditions and the type of\\nindividual biological response, the latter being determined\\nfrom clinical findings such as vital signs and GCS score.\\nThe use of ANNs in the setting of sepsis has not been\\nexplored.

Cler-\\nmont and coworkers [12] designed a prospective cohort study\\nincluding 1647 patients admitted to seven ICUs at a tertiary\\ncare centre. The predictor variables considered were age and\\nthe acute physiology variables of the Acute Physiology and\\nChronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score. They con-\\nstructed logistic regression and ANN models for a random set\\nof 1200 admissions (development set), and used the remain-\\ning 447 admissions as the validation set. Then, model con-\\nstruction was repeated on progressively smaller development\\nsets (800, 400 and 200 admissions) and re-tested in the orig-\\ninal validation set. As the size of the development set sample\\ndecreased, the performance of the model on the validation set\\ndeteriorated rapidly, although the ANNs retained marginally\\nbetter fit than logistic regression, as measured using the Hos-\\nmer-Lemeshow test, at 800 admissions. At under 800 admis-\\nsions, however, the fit was poor with both approaches. The\\nauthors concluded that both ANN and logistic regression have\\nsimilar performance with appropriate sample size, and share\\nthe same limitations with development sets on small samples.\\nNimgaonkar and coworkers [13] compared the performance\\nof the APACHE II score with that of a neural network in a med-\\nical-neurological ICU at a university hospital in Mumbai, India.\\nA total of 2062 consecutive admissions between 1996 and\\n1998 were evaluated. Data from 2962 patients were used to\\ntrain the neural network and data from the remaining 1000\\npatients were used to test the model and compare it with the\\nAPACHE II score. There were 337 deaths in these 1000\\npatients; APACHE II predicted 246 deaths whereas the neural\\nnetwork predicted 336 deaths. Calibration, as assessed using\\nthe Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, was better with the neural\\nnetwork than with APACHE II score, and so was discrimina-\\ntion. As probable explanations for this apparent superiority of\\nthe ANN, the authors suggested differences in demographic\\ncharacteristics and case-mix of patients in Indian ICUs. These\\nspecific features were certainly not accounted for in the origi-\\nnal Western cohorts used to develop and validate the\\nAPACHE score.\\nIn our research, both logistic regression and neural network\\nmodels did a good job of predicting death. Although there was\\na statistically significant difference in discrimination as meas-\\nured by ROC curve in favour of the neural network, the clinical\\nmeaning of this difference is not clear. A prediction model can-\\nnot be both perfectly reliable (i.e. calibrated) and perfectly dis-\\ncriminatory. According to Diamond [14], 'A model that\\nmaximizes discrimination does so at the expense of reliability\\n... On the other hand, a model that maximizes reliability does so\\nat the expense of discrimination, and thereby trades categori-\\ncal confidence for quantitative meaning.'\\nOne of the advantages of neural network analysis is that there\\nare few assumptions that must be verified before the models\\ncan be constructed; also, ANNs are able to model complex\\nnonlinear relationships between independent and dependent\\nvariables, and so they allow the inclusion of a large number of\\nvariables. The comparison method is supposed to constrain\\nthe neural network analysis by limiting the number of potential\\npredictor variables to the same set of predictor variables used\\nin the logistic regression analysis. However, in this practical\\nexample, our network was able to use all of the 10 initial varia-\\nFigure 1\\nObserved and predicted deaths with logistic regression and neural network in patients with suspected sepsis admitted to the emergency room\\nObserved and predicted deaths with logistic regression and neural network in patients with suspected sepsis admitted to the emergency room. \\nThere were no patients with scores 11 or 12 in the cohort.\\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\n1.2\\n0 (73)\\n1 (47)\\n2 (125)\\n3 (93)\\n4 (53)\\n5 (86)\\n6 (14)\\n7 (36)\\n8 (3)\\n9 (1)\\n10 (2)\\nScore (number of patients)\\nProbability of death\\nObserved\\nLogistic Model\\nNeural Network\\nCritical Care    April 2005\\n Vol 9 No 2    Jaimes et al.\\nR155\\nbles in its modelling, whereas logistic regression excluded four\\nvariables in the final model. Nevertheless, the predictive ability\\nwas almost the same with both approaches. A limitation of\\nANNs in the setting of aetiological research is that standard-\\nized coefficients and/or odds ratios corresponding to each\\nvariable cannot be calculated and presented as they can in\\nregression models. This lack of interpretability at the level of\\nindividual predictors is one of the most criticized features of\\nneural network models [15]. Furthermore, neural network\\nmodels require sophisticated software, and the computer\\nresources involved in training and testing neural networks can\\nbe substantial.\\nOur work has some limitations. First, the sample size – specif-\\nically the number of outcomes (101 deaths) – limit the number\\nof potential predictor variables. As a rule of thumb, no more\\nthat 10 outcome events for each independent variable are per-\\nmissible if over-fitting or under-fitting problems are to be\\navoided [16]. We tried to overcome this limitation by consid-\\nering just those variables that are more likely to be related to\\nmortality from a clinical point of view. However, as is usual in\\nany observational study, residual confounding or unmeasured\\nfactors may compromise the scope or precision of the model.\\nSecond, external validity was tested neither for logistic regres-\\nsion nor for the ANN. Furthermore, the small sample size pre-\\nvented a comprehensive split-sample validation with any\\nstrategy. Determination of the applicability and usefulness of\\nany predictive model requires independent and external valida-\\ntion in a population that is intrinsically different from the devel-\\nopment sample [17]. Therefore, both the proposed score and\\nthe neural network merit a new cohort study before any poten-\\ntial clinical use can be considered.\\nConclusion\\nA predictive model would be an extremely useful tool in the\\nsetting of suspected sepsis in the ER. It could serve both as a\\nguideline in medical decision-making regarding ICU admission\\nor specific therapies, and as a simple way to select or stratify\\npatients for clinical research. Our proposed model and the\\nspecific development method – either logistic regression or\\nneural networks – must be evaluated and validated in an inde-\\npendent population. Further research is required to determine\\nwhether there are practical or clinical advantages to one\\napproach over the other. As a general concept, we agree with\\nTu [15] that logistic regression remains the best choice when\\nthe primary goal of model development is to examine possible\\ncausal relationships among variables, but that some form of\\nhybrid technique incorporating the best features of both\\napproaches might lead to the development of optimal predic-\\ntion models.\\nCompeting interests\\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\\nAuthors' contributions\\nFJ conceived the study, participated in its design and coordi-\\nnation, performed the statistical analysis for logistic regres-\\nsion, and drafted the manuscript.

Computer techniques ranging from Information Re-\\ntrieval (IR) to Natural Language Processing can facilitate\\nautomated access to such patient records.1 Text classiﬁcation\\ncategorizes reports based on superﬁcial features of the text\\nas opposed to the deeper meaning of the language and may\\nbe easier to implement in clinical practice. In this study, we\\ncompare the ability of IR and statistical text categorization\\nalgorithms to identify patients (via x-ray reports) diagnosed\\nwith an acute fracture of the wrist (i.e., distal radius and/or\\nulna) out of all patients who had a forearm, wrist, or hand\\nx-ray.\\nFrom a technical perspective, this is not a trivial task, as\\nx-ray reports may describe old or other fractures and other\\ndiseases. From a clinical perspective, wrist fractures in older\\npatients are important to detect since treatment of osteopo-\\nrosis can decrease the risk of subsequent fractures. Auto-\\nmatic identiﬁcation of such patients would allow us to send\\nreminders to their physicians regarding osteoporosis man-\\nagement.\\nMethods\\nMaterial\\nTwo expert reviewers (AC, SO’D) classiﬁed 751 x-ray re-\\nports describing ﬁndings of a forearm, wrist, or hand x-ray\\nas consistent with the presence or absence of an acute wrist\\nfracture. Eligibility criteria included patients 40 years or\\nolder, seen at the Ottawa Hospital (an academic hospital in\\nEastern Ontario, Canada) between October 1, 2003 and\\nOctober 31, 2004. From the entire set of x-ray reports in this\\nperiod, we randomly selected 493 for derivation (included\\nﬁrst x-ray report in the study period) and 258 for validation\\n(included ﬁrst and last x-ray report). We used this selection\\nmethod for the validation set as we felt that, in future use,\\nthe text classiﬁer might need to evaluate repeat x-ray re-\\nports. The prevalence of acute wrist fractures was 43.2%\\n(213/493) and 34.1% (88/258) in the derivation and valida-\\ntion set respectively. The average length of all documents\\nwas 64 words, 95% had fewer than 150 words.\\nEvaluation\\nWe calculated the accuracy of the different text categori-\\nzation methods for correctly mimicking our manual clas-\\nsiﬁcations. Metrics were accuracy, sensitivity (or recall),\\nspeciﬁcity, and positive predictive value (PPV, or preci-\\nsion). We used a ten-fold cross-validation design that\\ninvolved randomly assigning reports to 1 of 10 sections or\\n’folds’; the model is then trained on 9 folds and tested on\\nthe 10th. Training and testing is repeated ten times so that\\neach fold serves as a test set once. Differences in accuracy\\nbetween classiﬁers in the 10-fold cross-validations were\\ntested for signiﬁcance with paired t-tests, pairing the\\nfolds.\\nPhase I\\nWe implemented three text classiﬁcation methods to auto-\\nmatically categorize the x-ray reports. The ﬁrst used an\\ninformation retrieval algorithm (IR-1) with a set of key\\nterms compiled by a radiologist.

Reports containing any of these predeﬁned terms were\\nclassiﬁed as ‘positive.’ To improve sensitivity, we truncated\\nthe terms to 4 characters and appended them with a wild-\\ncard character (method IR-1’).\\nFor the second technique (IR-2), we used terms selected by\\na computer based algorithm instead of an expert. This\\nfeature selection algorithm used Information Gain scores2\\nwhich are based on the number of times words or phrases\\nare observed in a positive or a negative document. The terms\\nwith the highest Information Gain were selected as features.\\nFor the third technique (TC-1), we used a machine-learning\\nalgorithm called a ‘support vector machine’ (SVM)3 which\\nhas been successful in data categorization. Information Gain\\nscores2 were used to select features for all reports, as with\\nIR-2. The SVM then used these features to create a decision\\ncriterion between ‘acute wrist fracture’ or ‘no such fracture’\\nfor new reports. Various parameter settings for the SVM and\\nthe feature selection phase were tested.\\nPhase II\\nWe compared the TC-1 results with 6 other machine learn-\\ning algorithms, as available in a benchmark toolkit named\\nWeka.4 Weka runs were repeated with various feature set\\nsizes, including a small (50) and large feature set (5000).\\nPhase III\\nWe validated TC-1 on a separate set of x-ray reports. This\\nvalidation set was kept quarantined until parameter opti-\\nmizing and training of the categorization model was com-\\npleted.\\nResults\\nPhase I\\nAlthough IR-1 showed high precision (or PPV) on the\\nderivation set (94.0%, Table 1) it missed almost half of the\\nwrist fracture cases (sensitivity � 51.6%). The overall accu-\\nracy of IR-1 was 77.7%. Using wildcards (IR-1’) improved\\nthe sensitivity to 68.1% at the expense of PPV (86.3%).\\nAccuracy rose to 81.5%. IR-2 had higher sensitivity (87.3%),\\nwhile the speciﬁcity remained high at 91.1% and PPV\\nslipped to 88.2%. IR-2 achieved an accuracy of 89.5%.\\nApplying the truncation and wildcard strategy within IR-2\\ndid not improve its performance (results not shown). The\\nTC-1 method was signiﬁcantly more accurate than the IR\\nmethods achieving an accuracy of 93.7% (p � 0.001, paired\\nt-test). The sensitivity and PPV were very good at 93.9% and\\n91.7% at the threshold setting that optimizes accuracy.\\nThe optimal parameters for the SVM were identiﬁed as:\\nlinear kernel, with the cost parameter that balances errors\\nwith a hard margin set to 0.005. Features were strings of one\\nto four words, no truncation was done and a stop word\\ncould not be a feature by itself but could be part of a\\nmulti-word feature. A maximum of 5,000 features was used.\\nThe cut-off (threshold) parameter was set to optimize accu-\\nracy; this parameter can be adjusted so that false-positives\\nand false-negatives trade off.\\nPhase II\\nUsing the same derivation set and cross-validation design,\\naccuracies for the Weka machine learning classiﬁers were:\\n84.6% (AdaBoost), 86.8% (K-Star), 87.2% (J48), 87.4% (Naive\\nBayes), 87.6% (JRip), and 88.0% (a Multi-layer Perceptron\\nneural network). All were signiﬁcantly lower than TC-1\\naccuracy (paired t-test, p � 0.001). The SMO algorithm in\\nWeka, an equivalent implementation of SVMs, achieved the\\nsame result as TC-1.\\nPhase III\\nTC-1 was applied to the previously quarantined validation\\nset, after it was retrained on the entire derivation set using\\nthe optimal parameter settings found in phase 1. Accuracy\\nof TC-1 was 93.8% at the default threshold (Table 1). A\\ncomparison of the derivation and validation ROC curves\\ndemonstrated that the TC-1 method discriminated between\\npositive and negative wrist fractures reports as accurately in\\nboth sets.\\nDiscussion\\nWe developed and validated an SVM based text classiﬁer\\nmethod (TC-1) which accurately categorizes textual wrist\\nx-ray reports into those with and without an acute wrist\\nfracture. Operating at 94% accuracy, TC-1 appears to be as\\nor more accurate than classiﬁers used on x-ray reports in\\nother studies such as Dreyer et al5 and Thomas et al,6\\nalthough a direct comparison of results is limited due to\\ndifferent study designs and data sets. TC-1 did outperform\\na number of well reputed classiﬁers on the same data set,\\nincluding Naive Bayes and a neural network.

We investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms – Support Vector Machine\\n(SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – to guide rehabilitation planning for home care clients.\\nMethods: This study is a secondary analysis of data on 24,724 longer-term clients from eight home\\ncare programs in Ontario. Data were collected with the RAI-HC assessment system, in which the\\nActivities of Daily Living Clinical Assessment Protocol (ADLCAP) is used to identify clients with\\nrehabilitation potential. For study purposes, a client is defined as having rehabilitation potential if\\nthere was: i) improvement in ADL functioning, or ii) discharge home. SVM and KNN results are\\ncompared with those obtained using the ADLCAP. For comparison, the machine learning\\nalgorithms use the same functional and health status indicators as the ADLCAP.\\nResults: The KNN and SVM algorithms achieved similar substantially improved performance over\\nthe ADLCAP, although false positive and false negative rates were still fairly high (FP &gt; .18, FN &gt;\\n.34 versus FP &gt; .29, FN. &gt; .58 for ADLCAP). Results are used to suggest potential revisions to the\\nADLCAP.\\nConclusion: Machine learning algorithms achieved superior predictions than the current protocol.\\nMachine learning results are less readily interpretable, but can also be used to guide development\\nof improved clinical protocols.\\nBackground\\nTargeting older clients for rehabilitation is a clinical chal-\\nlenge and a research priority [1]. For clients being assessed\\nfor home care services, the decision to provide rehabilita-\\ntion (especially physical or occupational therapy) has\\nmajor implications for the client's future quality of life\\nand independence, as well as major resource implications.\\nThere is considerable evidence of the feasibility and effec-\\ntiveness of rehabilitation in home-based settings [2-5];\\nthere is also evidence that many home care clients who\\nwould benefit from rehabilitation services do not receive\\nthem [6].\\nPublished: 20 December 2007\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\ndoi:10.1186/1472-6947-7-41\\nReceived: 4 September 2007\\nAccepted: 20 December 2007\\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\n© 2007 Zhu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 2 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nResource constraints will inevitably limit the provision of\\nrehabilitation services, but gaps in service also reflect gaps\\nand shortcomings in the management and use of availa-\\nble health information. More appropriate targeting of\\nrehabilitation therapy could be achieved through more\\ninformed care planning, but rehabilitation decisions are\\nparticularly challenging. For acute care patients, diagnoses\\nare often clearly defined. By contrast, rehabilitation\\npatients have considerable variability even within specific\\ndiagnostic categories. Assessment of rehabilitation poten-\\ntial and the potential success of rehabilitation for older\\npatients is not always straightforward, is often compli-\\ncated by medical complexity and multiple co-morbidities\\n[7,8], and requires management by multiple health pro-\\nfessionals in multiple care settings [9]. Our program of\\nresearch is aimed at understanding whether improved\\nclinical decision-making, and ultimately improved client\\noutcomes, could be achieved through more sophisticated\\nuse of routinely collected health assessment information.\\nIn this paper, we are continuing to investigate the poten-\\ntial for machine learning algorithms to guide rehabilita-\\ntion planning for home care clients. Machine learning\\ninvolves computer programs that use experience gained\\nfrom exploration of a dataset to improve performance or\\npredictive ability. These techniques are now being used\\nextensively in biomedical applications [10], for example\\nin predicting the role of genes and proteins. There has\\nbeen less use in support of clinical decision-making and\\nprediction, but these applications are increasing [11,12].\\nThere has been limited investigation of machine learning\\ntechniques in predicting rehabilitation outcomes [13,14].\\nAlthough some of these results have been ambiguous\\n[14], continued exploration in rehabilitation seems war-\\nranted given the importance and challenges of predicting\\nrehabilitation potential or outcomes [1,15,16]. Also, large\\ndatabases are becoming available in rehabilitation set-\\ntings, such as those based on the Functional Independ-\\nence Measure (FIM™, property of Uniform Data System\\nfor Medical Rehabilitation, a division of UB Foundation\\nActivities, Inc) or the interRAI assessment systems [17],\\nthat could be used for this purpose.\\nIn our previous work on the prediction of rehabilitation\\npotential, we applied a simple machine-learning algo-\\nrithm known as the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algo-\\nrithm, which, we argued, resembles clinical logic in that\\npredictions are based on outcomes experienced for similar\\npatients [18]. We found that KNN made significantly bet-\\nter predictions than the clinical assessment protocol – the\\n\"ADLCAP\" – currently in use within the health assessment\\ninformation system used for home care clients in Ontario,\\nCanada and other jurisdictions [19]. In this article, we\\nreport two follow-up studies (Study 1 and Study 2). The\\nresults and insights gained from these studies are then\\nused to inform potential revisions to the ADLCAP, and an\\ninitial assessment of the new method is given.\\nMethods\\nFor both studies reported below, ethics approval was\\nobtained from the Office of Research Ethics at the Univer-\\nsity of Waterloo.\\nStudy 1 Methods. Making predictions with support vector \\nmachines\\nBackground\\nIn our earlier paper [18], we speculated that the support\\nvector machine (SVM, [20]) could potentially improve\\nupon the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in two\\nways. First, being a state-of-the-art machine-learning algo-\\nrithm and a much more flexible kernel method than\\nKNN, SVM may give more accurate predictions. Second,\\nthe decision rule from SVM will only depend on a subset\\nof observations – called support vectors; these support vec-\\ntors can be regarded as prototypes and, if the total number\\nof support vectors turns out to be small, SVM will produce\\na much more parsimonious and interpretable model.\\nData\\nWe use the same data as used in our earlier report [18]:\\nRAI-HC data from eight Ontario Community Care Access\\nCentres (CCACs, the organizations that coordinate the\\nprovision of home care and long-term care services in the\\nprovince), consisting of 24,724 clients [mean age: 76.3\\n(sd = 13.9); 68.9% female; 15.7% with Alzheimer disease\\nor other dementia]. The true rehabilitation potential (y) of\\nthese clients can be reliably assessed from linked health\\nservice utilization data. For study purposes, a client is\\ndefined as having rehabilitation potential if there was: i)\\nimprovement in ADL functioning, or ii) discharge home.\\nImprovement in ADL functioning was defined as any\\nimprovement in the interRAI ADL Long Form scale\\nderived from the RAI-HC [21], over a follow-up period of\\napproximately one year. The rationale for this definition\\nis that for frail older clients for whom the likely course is\\nfunctional decline, any improvement in ADL functioning\\nis important. Also, persons discharged from home care\\nwho remain in their own homes (i.e., are not admitted to\\na long-term care home) can also be considered to have\\nhad a successful outcome. The interRAI/Minimum Data\\nSet instruments are a comprehensive assessment and\\nproblem identification system developed by an interna-\\ntional consortium of researchers (interRAI). The RAI-HC\\nis mandated for use in all of Ontario's CCACs for all\\nlonger-term clients (approximately 50% of the overall\\nCCAC case load). Repeat assessments are completed at\\nintervals of approximately 180 days. Assessment items\\ninclude: personal items, referral information, diagnoses,\\ncognition, communication and sensory functioning,\\nmood and behavior, physical functioning, continence,\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 3 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nnutrition status, oral health, skin condition, environmen-\\ntal issues, informal support services and service utiliza-\\ntion, and other information. Clinical Assessment\\nProtocols (CAPs) are triggered when specified combina-\\ntions of assessment items indicate that problems or risks\\nare present that warrant intervention or further investiga-\\ntion [19]. The CAP most relevant to rehabilitation plan-\\nning is the Activities of Daily Living Clinical Assessment\\nProtocol, or ADLCAP.\\nIn our earlier work we compared results using the ADL-\\nCAP with results obtained using the KNN machine learn-\\ning algorithm [18]. In order to make conservative and fair\\ncomparisons with the ADLCAP, we used only covariates\\nthat are in the ADLCAP – 19 altogether. Moreover, we also\\ninterpreted these covariates in the same way as the ADL-\\nCAP. For example, the ADLCAP treats the predictor h2a\\n(mobility in bed) in the following way:\\nif h2a = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8 (indicating levels of depend-\\nence);\\nthen consider as dependent;\\nelse (meaning h2a = 0 or 1, indicating independence)\\nconsider as independent.\\nIn other words, suppose that client A has h2a = 2 and cli-\\nent B has h2a = 6. The ADLCAP does not distinguish these\\ntwo clients with regard to h2a. Therefore, we can recode\\nh2a as a binary variable as follows: recode 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and\\n8 as one and recode all other values (0 and 1) as zero.\\nTable 1 summarizes how the covariates are recoded\\naccording to ADLCAP. Also included in Table 1 are the\\npercent of clients in the dataset for whom each covariate\\nis present (% = 1), the chi-square statistic for testing the\\ncorrelation between each covariate and the response, and\\nthe Pearson correlation (corr.) between each covariate and\\nthe response. (Since the response is binary and covariates\\nhere are also recoded as binary, the Pearson correlation is\\nnot exactly the right correlation coefficient to use. The chi-\\nsquare statistic is more commonly used. However, the\\nusual Pearson correlation coefficients are still included\\nhere for the following reason. Since we have a sample size\\nof about 25,000, the chi-square statistics are all very large,\\nreflecting the well-known caveat of classical hypothesis\\ntesting that one can reject any null hypothesis with a large\\nenough sample size. The absolute magnitude of these chi-\\nsquare statistics should not be interpreted in the usual\\nway, but their relative magnitude is still meaningful.)\\nThe Support Vector Machine\\nThe SVM [20] is a prediction algorithm that has received a\\ntremendous amount of attention in the machine learning\\ncommunity during the last decade. Suppose xnew is a vector\\ncontaining all the covariates for a new observation. To\\npredict its outcome, SVM uses quadratic programming to\\nconstruct a model of the following form:\\nwhere w0 and wi are model coefficients; and K(u;v) is a ker-\\nnel function. Once the parameters w0 and wi are estimated,\\nthe final model depends only on a subset of the training\\ndata, denoted above by \"SV\" – they are called support vec-\\ntors and are automatically determined by the SVM algo-\\nrithm. To fit the SVM, we use a library called \"e1071\" in R\\n[22].\\nPerformance Evaluation\\nTo fit an SVM model, we choose the default kernel func-\\ntion, the radial basis kernel. Among the four options pro-\\nvided by the \"e1071\" library – linear, polynomial, radial\\nbasis, and sigmoid – the radial basis kernel is also the\\nmost compatible with a distance-based method such as\\nthe KNN. To use SVM with the radial basis kernel, there\\nare two tuning parameters that we must specify a priori:\\none that controls the width of the kernel function, which\\nwe denote here by γ; and another that essentially controls\\nhow many support vectors the algorithm will ultimately\\nselect, which we denote here by C. The performance of\\nSVM is sensitive to these tuning parameters and the opti-\\nmal value of these parameters are problem-specific.\\nTo determine the best values of these parameters for our\\nproblem and evaluate the final predictive power of SVMs,\\nwe use the same analytic framework as in our earlier study\\n[18]. In particular, we make predictions for the eight\\nCCAC datasets one by one. For example, when making\\npredictions for region 1, we randomly sample 2500 obser-\\nvations from regions 2–8 and use them as the training set\\nfor building the SVM. Tuning parameters are selected by\\nperforming 5-fold cross-validation on the training set\\nalone using the overall error rate as the guiding criterion.\\nData from region 1 are not used to build the SVM or select\\nthe tuning parameters. This procedure guarantees that our\\nSVMs do not use any information from the data they are\\nabout to predict, so their predictive performances can be\\nfairly evaluated.\\nSince we construct and use different training sets to make\\npredictions for different regions, we have a total of eight\\ndifferent training sets. After performing cross-validation\\non each of them, eight slightly different sets of optimal\\ntuning parameters are obtained. They turn out to be quite\\nclose to each other. Generally, the optimal parameters are\\naround γ = 0.06 and C = 0.24.\\nf x\\nw\\nw K x\\nx\\nnew\\ni\\nnew\\ni\\nx\\nSV\\ni\\n(\\n)\\n;\\n,\\n=\\n+\\n(\\n)\\n∈∑\\n0\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 4 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nPrediction accuracy is then evaluated using exactly the\\nsame four criteria as in [18], namely, the false positive\\n(false+) and false negative (false-) rates, and the positive\\nand negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR+ and DLR-\\n).\\nStudy 2 Methods. Relaxation of covariates\\nBackground\\nWe have pointed out that the ADLCAP seemed to inter-\\npret the covariates in a rather restrictive manner [18]. For\\nexample, for variables h2a – h2j, the ADLCAP did not dif-\\nferentiate among the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. This might\\nlead to a loss of information. We speculated that one\\ncould possibly improve the prediction accuracy of various\\nmachine-learning algorithms if no such arbitrary restric-\\ntions were imposed [18].\\nData\\nWe use the original RAI-HC datasets without recoding the\\nvariables according to Table 1, except that, for variables\\nh2a – h2j, we recode the value 8 (\"activity did not occur\")\\ninto a 6 (total dependence) following conventional inter-\\nRAI practice of combining \"8s\" with the most severe\\nimpairment level [23].

Again, we do this with cross-vali-\\ndation. The parameters chosen are: K = 20, C = 1.25, and\\nγ = 0.01.\\nResults\\nStudy 1 Results. Making predictions with support vector \\nmachines\\nContrary to our speculations [18], we find that, for this\\nparticular problem, SVM does not offer a statistically sig-\\nnificant improvement over KNN in terms of prediction\\naccuracy (Table 2). In addition, about 75% of the obser-\\nvations are selected by SVM as support vectors. Hence,\\nthere is hardly any gain in terms of parsimony or inter-\\npretability.\\nHowever, this does not mean that SVM is completely use-\\nless for our problem. In SVM, observations chosen as sup-\\nport vectors are either very close to or on the wrong side\\nof the decision boundary. Non-support vectors, on the\\nother hand, are on the correct side of the boundary and at\\nleast a certain distance away from it; they are the easy-to-\\nclassify observations in the dataset [20]. In our context,\\nthese are clients that, according to SVM, either clearly have\\nor clearly do not have any rehabilitation potential. A care-\\nful examination of these two groups of clients, therefore,\\ncan yield additional insights.\\nWe build an SVM with a random sample of 10,000 obser-\\nvations from all eight CCAC datasets and examine the\\nresulting two groups of support vectors. In Table 3, each\\nrow shows the fraction of observations in each of these\\ntwo group whose corresponding covariate is equal to 1 –\\nrecall from Table 1 that all covariates had been recoded in\\nour study to be binary. It is evident from Table 3, that\\nthese two groups of clients are most different in terms of\\nh2j, h7a, and h7c, which suggests that they are the most\\nimportant variables for predicting rehabilitation poten-\\ntial.\\nWe then perform a slightly different analysis to verify this\\nresult. Recall that, along our earlier analyses, we have cre-\\nated eight different training datasets, each consisting of\\n2500 observations. On each of these eight datasets, we\\nperform stepwise variable selection on a standard logistic\\nregression model using the Akaike Information Criterion\\n(AIC) as the selection criterion. This is done with the func-\\ntions \"glm\" and \"stepAIC\" in R [22]. We thus obtain eight\\nslightly different subsets of selected variables. The only\\nvariables that appear in the intersection of all eight subsets\\nare h2j – independent in bathing, h7a – client optimistic\\nabout functional improvement, and h7c – client rated as\\nhaving good prospects of recovery.\\nSummary\\nLike KNN, SVM predicts rehabilitation potential better\\nthan the ADLCAP, but there is little statistical difference\\nbetween KNN and SVM. Analysis using the SVM reveals\\nthat the most important variables for predicting rehabili-\\ntation potential are h2j – independent in bathing, h7a –\\nclient optimistic about functional improvement, and h7c\\n– client rated as having good prospect of recovery.\\nStudy 2 Results.

The analysis that provides us with an insight into this\\npeculiarity is described below. The insight gained from\\nthis analysis not only resolves this mystery for us; it also\\nsuggests a new method of defining the ADLCAP.\\nTake the covariate h2a for example. Using all the data, we\\ncan estimate the following ratio:\\nIf \\n &gt; 1, this means it is more likely for those with reha-\\nbilitation potential to score a zero on item h2a. Likewise,\\nif \\n &lt; 1, it means it is more likely for those without\\nrehabilitation potential to score a zero on this item.\\nCall \\n the (likelihood) ratio profile of h2a.\\nFor the sake of argument, suppose the ratio profile of h2a\\nlooks like this: {5, 4, 3, 2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1}. Such a profile\\nwould mean that clients with rehabilitation potential are 5\\ntimes more likely than those without potential to score a 0\\non item h2a, 4 times more likely to score a 1, 3 times more\\nlikely to score a 2, and 2 times more likely to score a 3. On\\nthe other hand, clients without rehabilitation potential are\\n10 times more likely to score a 6, 5 times more likely to\\nscore a 5 and 2 times more likely to score a 4.\\nBased on such a profile, how would one use h2a (alone)\\nto predict rehabilitation potential y ? The obvious answer\\nis as follows:\\nor\\nNow, define the ratio profile score for h2a as\\nIn the hypothetical illustration above, we would have Sh2a\\n= 5 ÷ (0.5) = 10. This score can be treated as a rough meas-\\nure of how accurately one can predict rehabilitation\\npotential using the covariate h2a. The higher the score, the\\nbetter.\\nFigure 1 shows the ratio profiles of all 19 covariates\\ntogether with their corresponding ratio profile scores; the\\nhorizontal line in each profile plot is the critical line at\\nwhich the ratio is equal to 1. We can make the following\\nobservations:\\n1. The three covariates with the highest ratio profile scores\\nare: h7c – good prospect of recovery (Sh7c = 4.14), h2j –\\nbathing (Sh2j = 3.12), and h7a – client optimistic about\\nfunctional improvement (Sh7a = 3.01). This is, again, in\\nexact agreement with our results from Study 1.\\n2. The covariates h7c and h7a are not affected whether we\\nuse the original scale or not (see Figure 1).\\n3. Based on the ratio profile of h2j, the best way to use h2j\\nfor prediction is as follows: \\n = 1 if h2 j = 0, 1; \\n = 0 if h2\\nj = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That is, for h2j, the recoded scale is actually\\nthe best, better than the original scale which uses more\\ninformation on levels of impairment. Using the original\\nscale turns out to only add extra noise to our underlying\\nprediction problem.\\n4. For covariates in the h2* category (h2a – h2j), h2i has\\nthe second highest score (Sh2i = 1.41). Based on its ratio\\nprofile, the best way to use h2i for prediction is as follows:\\n = 1 if h2i = 0 ; \\n = 0 if h2i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That is, for\\nh2i, the recoded scale is almost the best. It would have\\nbeen better to separate 0 from 1–6 rather than grouping 0\\nand 1 together (see Figure 1). In fact, the same can be said\\nabout most other covariates in the h2* category – except\\nh2d. For these covariates, using the original scale adds\\nsome extra noise, but it also introduces the opportunity\\nfor an algorithm to use these covariates in a more optimal\\nway.\\n5. The ratio profiles of c3 and p6 indicate that the recoded\\nscales severely mask the information contained in these\\ncovariates for predicting rehabilitation potential. There is\\nextra information in the original scale. In both cases, it\\nwould have been better to recode \"0\" into \"0\" and every-\\nthing else into \"1\".\\nThese observations suggest that there is a tradeoff between\\nusing the original and the recoded scales. On the one\\nhand, there is some extra information useful for predic-\\ntion if the original scales are used.

Generally speaking, it would have been better\\nto define the ratio profile score (for covariate x) as\\nHowever, it can easily be seen from Figure 1 that, for most\\ncovariates in our dataset, there is only one ratio above the\\ncritical threshold of one. For these covariates, the two ver-\\nsions of the ratio profile scores are identical, that is, \\n =\\nSx. The only exceptions are: h2d and h2j. In the case of\\nh2d, Figure 1 shows that the two bars above the critical\\nthreshold \\nare \\nof \\nsimilar \\nheights, \\ni.e.,\\n. So we expect\\n to be very close to Sh2d as well, and it does not matter\\nvery much which one is used in practice. For h2j, however,\\nit is clear from Figure 1 that \\n is much\\nsmaller than \\n, which means h2j\\nwould have had a much lower score had we used the more\\ngeneral definition, \\n. But it is also clear from Figure 1\\nthat h2j is actually one of the stronger predictive variables,\\nand using the more general definition would have\\nseverely understated its true predictive power. Based on\\nthese considerations, we chose to use a definition that is\\nnot completely general but more suitable for our specific\\npurposes here.\\nTo explain the peculiar and counter-intuitive results in\\nTables 4 and 5, we conjecture that KNN has suffered more\\nthan benefited from this particular tradeoff, whereas SVM,\\nbeing a more sophisticated and robust algorithm, has\\nbenefited more than suffered from it. This conjecture is\\nconfirmed by simulation experiments, which we describe\\nin the Appendix.\\nSummary and new method of defining ADLCAP\\nThe peculiar results from applying KNN and SVM to the\\n\"relaxed datasets\" have led us to carry out an in-depth\\ninvestigation. As a result, we are able to gain significant\\nnew insight into the nature of the problem. We find that\\nthe implicit recoding of the covariates by the ADLCAP\\n(Table 1) is, generally speaking, quite reasonable; it is\\nclose to being optimal for the most influential covariates.\\nMore importantly, however, our investigation suggests a\\nnew method of defining the ADLCAP, one that is based\\non an analysis of the covariates' (likelihood) ratio profiles\\n(Figure 1).\\nFigure 1 contains rich information. Take the covariate c3\\nfor an example. The bar at c3 = 0 is higher than the critical\\nhorizontal line with height 1. This means that, if c3 = 0, it\\nis more likely that the client has rehabilitation potential.\\nOn the other hand, the bars at c3 = 1, 2, 3, 4 are all lower\\nthan the critical line. This means if c3 = 1, 2, 3, 4, it is more\\nlikely that the client does not have rehabilitation poten-\\ntial. Clearly, such information can be used to make predic-\\ntions. It is also clear from Figure 1 that the information\\ncontained in the ratio profile of c3 is not as good as that\\ncontained in the ratio profile of, say h7c, because h7c has\\na much higher ratio profile score (4.14 versus 1.49). Thus,\\ndecisions based on different covariates should be\\nweighted accordingly. An alternative ADLCAP based on\\nthis argument is outlined in Table 6.\\nThe use of threshold = 15.8 in Table 6 is somewhat arbi-\\ntrary; it is only selected so that we can make an initial\\nassessment. On the eight CCAC datasets (n = 24,724), the\\nADLCAP is triggered for 8,913 clients, i.e., about 36.05%.\\nTo allow us to make a fair comparison, we reason back-\\nwards by asking: what would the threshold have to be so\\nthat 36.05% of all the clients would score above this\\nthreshold value on the alternative ADLCAP as well? The\\nanswer turns out to be 15.8.

If informa-\\ntion systems are used to ensure appropriate and equitable\\naccess to rehabilitation services, there will be major bene-\\nfits to the health, quality of life and independence of reha-\\nbilitation clients. There will also be major health system\\nbenefits through decreased costs, more appropriate\\nresource use, and avoided institutional placements.\\nIn the first study reported here, we found that the support\\nvector machine (SVM) predicts rehabilitation potential\\nbetter than the ADLCAP, but there is little statistical differ-\\nence between SVM and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN)\\nalgorithm [18]. In addition, the SVM did not really give a\\nmore parsimonious model. Using the SVM, however, we\\nwere able to find that the most important predictors for\\nthis particular prediction task are dependence in bathing\\n(h2j), the client being optimistic about functional\\nimprovement (h7a), and good prospects of recovery from\\ncurrent conditions (h7c). In the second study, we found\\nthat the implicit recoding of the covariates by the ADLCAP\\n(Table 1) is generally quite reasonable, especially for the\\nmost important predictors. We then described a simple\\nanalysis based on the covariates' (likelihood) ratio pro-\\nfiles and showed that such an analysis can lead to a new\\nmethod of defining the ADLCAP. Our initial assessment\\nshowed that the alternative ADLCAP thus defined is capa-\\nble of producing predictions that are competitive against\\nthe machine learning algorithms we have experimented\\nwith so far.\\nWe believe our work to date supports continued investiga-\\ntion of the potential for advanced statistical techniques,\\nincluding machine learning algorithms, to support care\\nplanning for rehabilitation. Both of the machine learning\\ntechniques we have explored, the KNN and SVM algo-\\nrithms, have achieved substantially improved perform-\\nance over a currently used clinical protocol. Reservations\\nabout the use of these methods include the interpretabil-\\nity of their results, and the resulting potential for clinical\\nresistance to a \"black box\" approach. For this reason we\\nhave so far chosen methods that could be seen as analo-\\ngous to clinical reasoning (KNN) or that could identify\\nprototypical cases that could aid interpretation (SVM). In\\naddition to improved statistical prediction, our work\\npoints to an additional, and possibly more important,\\nbenefit of these methods. Our analyses of the machine\\nlearning results have provided insights into the factors\\nthat may be most influential in predicting rehabilitation\\npotential – \"the contents of the black box\" – and also into\\noptimal ways to categorize these variables (i.e., to define\\nclinical cutpoints). We have also shown how these results\\ncould be used to redefine the clinical protocol to achieve\\nresults similar to that achieved using machine learning\\nalgorithms.\\nConclusion\\nMachine learning algorithms achieved superior predic-\\ntions than the current protocol, although the results are\\nless readily interpretable. We recognize that targeting cli-\\nents for rehabilitation remains a challenge, and any man-\\nageable health information system will be limited in its\\nability to predict rehabilitation potential. We suggest\\nhowever that we have illustrated how machine learning\\ntechniques can \"set the bar\" for clinical predictions, and\\nalso how machine learning can be used to refine clinical\\nprotocols to achieve comparable performance.\\nCompeting interests\\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing\\ninterests.\\nTable 7: Comparison of prediction performances. \"OLD\" = the original ADLCAP, same as [18] and Table 2; \"SVM\" = SVM using \\nrelaxed dataset, same as Table 5, column \"New\"; \"NEW\" = alternative ADLCAP (Table 6).\\nOverall Error\\nFalse +\\nFalse -\\nDLR +\\nDLR -\\nRegio\\nn\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\n1\\n0.37\\n0.34\\n0.36\\n0.30\\n0.34\\n0.36\\n0.65\\n0.33\\n0.37\\n1.18\\n1.97\\n1.75\\n0.92\\n0.50\\n0.58\\n2\\n0.37\\n0.30\\n0.30\\n0.31\\n0.26\\n0.25\\n0.62\\n0.42\\n0.48\\n1.24\\n2.20\\n2.10\\n0.89\\n0.57\\n0.64\\n3\\n0.38\\n0.34\\n0.32\\n0.32\\n0.33\\n0.28\\n0.63\\n0.42\\n0.50\\n1.14\\n1.77\\n1.79\\n0.93\\n0.63\\n0.69\\n4\\n0.46\\n0.31\\n0.34\\n0.36\\n0.28\\n0.31\\n0.65\\n0.37\\n0.39\\n0.99\\n2.24\\n1.99\\n1.00\\n0.51\\n0.56\\n5\\n0.31\\n0.23\\n0.20\\n0.27\\n0.20\\n0.16\\n0.67\\n0.45\\n0.52\\n1.25\\n2.69\\n3.05\\n0.91\\n0.57\\n0.62\\n6\\n0.43\\n0.29\\n0.27\\n0.38\\n0.26\\n0.22\\n0.62\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n1.01\\n2.36\\n2.53\\n1.00\\n0.53\\n0.58\\n7\\n0.48\\n0.31\\n0.32\\n0.43\\n0.29\\n0.29\\n0.59\\n0.35\\n0.38\\n0.95\\n2.23\\n2.17\\n1.04\\n0.49\\n0.53\\n8\\n0.42\\n0.32\\n0.29\\n0.37\\n0.30\\n0.23\\n0.62\\n0.38\\n0.49\\n1.03\\n2.04\\n2.16\\n0.98\\n0.55\\n0.64\\nMean\\n0.40\\n0.30\\n0.30\\n0.34\\n0.28\\n0.26\\n0.63\\n0.39\\n0.45\\n1.10\\n2.19\\n2.19\\n0.96\\n0.54\\n0.61\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 11 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nAuthors' contributions\\nMZ, JPH and PS all participated in the conceptualization\\nand design of the study.

In\\neach experiment, we first generate a training sample of\\n1250 observations, each with two predictors (x1, x2) and a\\nbinary outcome y. The first 1000 samples belong to one\\nclass (y = 0) and the remaining 250 belong to the other\\n(y = 1). The two predictors are generated independently\\nusing probability distributions specified in Table 8. Then,\\nan independent test sample of 1250 observations are gen-\\nerated using exactly the same mechanism.\\nThe predictor x1 is designed to mimic the behavior of h2j,\\nwhereas the predictor x2 is designed to mimic the behavior\\nof a typical h2* covariate such as h2i. In particular, for x1,\\nwe have \\n = 4 &gt; 1 and \\n &lt; 1 for all j = 2, 3, 4, 5,\\n6. That is, just like h2j, the recoded scale is optimal for x1.\\nFor x2, we have \\n = 2 &gt; 1 and \\n &lt; 1 for all j = 1, 2, 3,\\n4, 5, 6. That is, just like most of the h2* covariates, the\\nrecoded scale is close to being optimal for x2, but it would\\nhave been better to separate 0 from 1–6 rather than group-\\ning 0 and 1 together (Table 8). The correct decision is to\\npredict \\n = 1 if and only if (x1, x2) = (0, 0) or (1, 0).\\nThe true decision surface is shown in Figure 2. The distri-\\nbutions of (x1, x2) are deliberately made somewhat noisy\\nand irregular for x1 ≥ 2 and x2 ≥ 1. As a result, we can see\\nthat there is a small but noticeable bump in the true deci-\\nsion surface around (x1, x2) = (0, 4) and (1, 4) (Figure 2).\\nThis will increase the chance for data-driven algorithms to\\nmake mistakes in this region.\\nWe then fit a KNN and an SVM model on the training\\nsample and use them to predict the test sample. We do\\nthis once with the predictors (x1, x2) in their original scale\\nand once with the predictors recoded according to Table 1\\nas if they were h2j and h2i.\\nThe overall error rates of KNN and SVM from the 10 sim-\\nulations are shown using boxplots in Figure 3. The per-\\nformances of KNN and SVM are almost identical when\\napplied to the recoded variables, but when applied to the\\noriginal variables, SVM performs slightly better whereas\\nKNN performs slightly worse.\\nFigure 4 gives more insight into why this is the case.

It is also clear that, when the original\\nscales are used, KNN is more likely than SVM to be\\n\"fooled\" by the extra bump near (x1, x2) = (0, 4). In addi-\\ntion, when the original scales are used, SVM can be seen\\nto have a much better chance of making the correct predic-\\ntion of \\n = 0 at (x1, x2) = (1, 1).\\nFinally, it is worth noting that there is considerable noise\\nin our simulated data. Even if we used the true underlying\\ndecision surface (Figure 2) to make predictions, we would\\nstill make considerable misclassification error. Therefore,\\na high error rate alone should not be taken as an indica-\\ntion that algorithms such as KNN and SVM are perform-\\ning poorly. In this case, it is rather an indication that the\\nunderlying data are very noisy. In fact, the decision surface\\nestimated by SVM (Figure 4) in this simulation was not far\\nfrom the true decision surface (Figure 2).\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis study was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health \\nResearch Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis.\\nReferences\\n1.\\nStolee P, Borrie MJ, Cook S, Hollomby J, the participants of the Cana-\\ndian Consensus Workshop on Geriatric Rehabilitation: A research\\nagenda for geriatric rehabilitation: The Canadian consensus.\\nGeriatr Today: J Can Geriatr Soc 2004, 7:38-42.\\n2.\\nGiusti A, Barone A, Oliveri M, Pizzonia M, Razzano M, Palummari E,\\nPioli G: An analysis of the feasibility of home rehabilitation\\namong elderly people with proximal femoral fractures.

Discordance between data stored in Electronic Health Records (EHR) \\nmay have a harmful effect on patient care. Automatic identification of such \\nsituations is an important yet challenging task, especially when the discordance \\ninvolves information stored in free text fields. Here we present a method to \\nautomatically detect inconsistencies between data stored in free text and related \\ncoded fields. Using EHR data we train an ensemble of classifiers to predict the \\nvalue of coded fields from the free text fields.

Clinical Decision Support, NLP, Machine Learning, EHR \\nIntroduction \\nA key issue in electronic health record (EHR) design is balancing between the \\nexpressive power of storing data in free text fields, versus the benefits of using coded \\nfields, where the clinician chooses a code from a predefined list [1]. While the use of \\nfree text facilitates rapid and relatively convenient data entry, using predefined codes \\ncan enhance EHR retrieval, mining, and analysis, and may improve communication \\nbetween care givers [2]. Most EHR implementations therefore rely on both methods.  \\nOften, both free text and coded fields are available for storing a particular data type, \\nenabling clinicians to input potentially contradictory data [3,4]. Discordance between \\ndata in the EHR may lead to confusion and mistakes in patient care [4] and may result \\nin spurious conclusions of applications that utilize EHR data. Identifying discordances \\nbetween free text and coded fields is a challenging task, and typically requires \\nextensive work by a domain expert [3, 4].  \\nHere we present a method to automatically identify inconsistencies between free \\ntext and associated coded fields in EHRs. In short, our method works by predicting the \\nmost expected code, based on the available free text data, and highlighting cases where \\nthis prediction is different from the actual code selected by the clinician. Specifically, \\n                                                           \\n1 Corresponding Author: Ruty Rinott, E-mail: rutyr@il.ibm.com.  65 Aba Hushi st., Haifa 31905, Israel  \\n \\nQuality of Life through Quality of Information\\nJ.

We then use \\nthe obtained classifiers to predict the code based on the free text. Cases for which all \\nclassifiers predict the same code, while the clinician has selected a different code, are \\nmarked as potential inconsistencies. We report encouraging results over a real world \\ndataset of 734 discharge letters of Sarcoma patients that supports the validity of our \\nproposed strategy.  \\n1. Materials &amp; Methods  \\nData. We demonstrate our methodology over anonymized discharge letters of Soft \\nTissue Sarcoma patients treated at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori \\n(INT) between 2006 and 2011.  The letters are stored using the CDA standard as \\ndefined by the Lombardy Oncology Network and contain both free text and coded \\nfields. The data includes 734 discharge letters, termed \"documents\" that span 456 \\ntreatment programs. We identified 5 coded fields that capture information which is also \\ndescribed to some extent in free text fields, as described in Table 1. Each row in Table \\n1 represents a separate inconsistency detection task, handled using the methods \\ndescribed below. \\nTable 1.

For each task we define the data (X) and labels (Y). X is \\ncreated from free text data, using the Bag Of Words (BOW) model [6]. Specifically, \\nthe data is represented by a matrix where the rows correspond to documents and the \\ncolumns correspond to words appearing in the documents. Here we use the “sign” \\nversion of the BOW model, where Xij=1 if word j appears in the relevant text fields of \\ndocument i, and 0 otherwise. For tasks that involve multiple free text fields, we \\nconsider in which field the word appeared. Thus, if the word j appears in k different \\nfree text fields, we represent it by k features. Tokenizing and stemming was done using \\nLucene Italian Analyzer [7]. The labels, Y, are defined via the codes appearing in the \\nrelevant coded field. For two of the tasks, TP and Presentation, there was not enough \\ninformation in the free text to properly train a classifier that will be able to differentiate \\nbetween all codes. Hence, for these tasks, we used domain knowledge to aggregate the \\ncodes into a smaller set of high-level codes, which we used as labels.  \\nR. Rinott et al. / Automatic Detection of Inconsistencies Between Free Text and Coded Data\\n662\\nClassification Algorithms. To reduce the number of falsely reported \\ninconsistencies we used an ensemble of classifiers for each task [5]. We selected three \\nclassifiers which use diverse classification approaches, do not require tuning of many \\nparameters, and provide a confidence associated with the prediction: Naïve Bayes (NB) \\n[8], K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) [9], and Multi-class Decision Tree (MDT) [10]. We \\nused the Matlab implementation of NB and MDT, with the posterior probability of the \\nmost probable class (MAP) as the confidence estimation. For the KNN classifier we \\nused Cosine similarity over the TF-IDF BOW matrix [6], with k=7. Confidence was \\ndefined as the percent of neighbors agreeing with the predicted label, weighted by their \\nsimilarity to the query instance. For each classifier, we also estimated the confidence \\nthat the code selected by the clinician is inconsistent (termed inconsistency confidence), \\ncalculated as one minus the probability associated with the code chosen by the clinician. \\nThe classifiers were trained using the leave-one-out scheme: for every document, we \\ntrained the classifiers using all other documents, and then used the classifier to predict \\nthe document's code, and estimate the prediction and inconsistency confidence.  \\nLearning in the presence of noisy labels. Unlike conventional classification \\nsettings that assume that the labels of the training data are all correct, here, we assume \\nthat the data contains inconsistencies, implying that for some instance in the training \\nset, the label (i.e., code) provided by the clinician is incorrect. These mislabeled \\ninstances may decrease the prediction accuracy of the classifiers, even if they occur in a \\nsmall fraction of the data [11]. To alleviate this problem we removed from the training \\ndata instances which are highly suspected as being mislabeled, using a method \\nreminiscent to that suggested in [11]. Namely, after the first round of training and \\nclassification, we removed from the training data all instances for which all three \\nclassifiers predicted with high confidence a code different from that selected by the \\nclinician. The confidence threshold was chosen for each classifier so that at most 20% \\nof the data is considered mislabeled. We then repeated the training process, using the \\nfiltered training data. These classifiers are used to predict the label and confidence for \\nall the documents (including those removed in the first step). \\n2. Results \\n2.1. Classification results \\nWe first estimated our classifiers performance by comparing their predictions with the \\nclinicians' choice. Admittedly, this is not a perfect measure, since some of the observed \\ndisagreements reflect a mistake made by the clinician. Nonetheless, as we assume that \\ninconsistencies are relatively rare in the data, this seems like an initial reasonable \\nmeasure.  Table 2 summarizes these results for all tasks in terms of micro-averaged \\nrecall and precision [12].  \\nTable 2. Micro-averaged recall and precision for each task.

In addition, in the three tasks for which we did not aggregate \\nthe codes, the classifiers prediction can further serve as a suggestion for the correct \\ncode. For these tasks the domain experts determined if the predicted code is indeed the \\ncorrect code. The results are summarized in Table 3. To further improve the precision \\nof our method, we can mark as potentially inconsistent only cases for which the \\naverage inconsistency confidence of the classifiers is high. In theory, this requires \\nlearning a confidence threshold for each task. In practice, since our data is relatively \\nsmall, learning such a threshold may result in over fitting the data. However, to \\ndemonstrate the utility of using the inconsistency confidence, we report the percent of \\ncases correctly predicted as inconsistent when examining only the top 50% cases, \\nranked according to confidence. As indicated by the last column of Table 3, this \\nimproves the precision of our method for most tasks, in some cases by a factor of 2.5. \\nThe fairly high variance in the precision of our method for different tasks is not \\nsurprising, as the complexity of the different free text fields - and their correlation with \\nthe codified field data - highly differs from task to task. An extreme example is \\npredicting the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) code from the \\nclinical summary field. This is a very general field clinicians use to summarize \\ndifferent aspects of the patients hospitalization episode, and sometimes contains little \\nor no information regarding the tumor's response, as reflected by the large fraction of \\ncases for which there was not enough information to determine if the code is consistent.  \\nTable 3.

Inspection of the data reveals that there are 26 cases \\nfor which the diagnosis according to the free text was Fibromyxosarcoma. For 20 of \\nthese, the ICDO-M code selected by the clinician was “Malignant fibrous \\nhistiocytoma” while for the remaining 6, the selected code was “Sarcoma, not \\notherwise specified (NOS)”. The ROL version used at the time the data was collected \\ndid not contain a specific code for Fibromyxosarcoma, and thus the clinicians should \\nhave chosen the general “Sarcoma, NOS” code. Since most clinicians chose the same \\nincorrect code, our classifier learned from that mistake, and marked the cases in which \\n“Sarcoma, NOS” was (properly) chosen as inconsistent. This demonstrates that cases in \\nR. Rinott et al. / Automatic Detection of Inconsistencies Between Free Text and Coded Data\\n664\\nwhich clinicians repeatedly make the same mistake pose a challenge to our method. \\nHowever, we believe that such cases are rare, and will usually occur when there is a \\nlacking or ill-defined code. In such cases, as this example shows, our method highlights \\na potential problem, although it does not identify the inconsistent cases correctly. \\nIndeed, in the current ROL version, a new code for Fibromyxosarcoma was added.  \\n3. Discussion \\nIn spite of advances in development and standardization of ontologies and \\nterminologies, the use of free text in EHR is still very common and will probably \\nremain so in the near future. This raises the need for automatic detection of \\ndiscordances in EHR, using the free text information. Here we presented an automatic \\nmethod to detect inconsistencies between free text and coded fields in clinical data and \\ndemonstrated its validity over clinical discharge summaries of STS patients.  \\nSeveral directions can be pursued to improve the accuracy of our method. First, \\ngiven a larger EHR dataset will probably increase the precision of the examined \\nclassifiers, and will further allow considering more advanced classification schemes. \\nSecond, much progress can be made in the free text representation. Here we used the \\nBOW model which has the advantage of simplicity, but loses much information such as \\nnegation and factuality level. Advancing beyond BOW representations certainly merits \\nfurther investigation. \\nHere we used our method to retrospectively examine clinical records. A valuable \\nfuture implementation is in online detection, drawing the clinician’s attention to \\ninconsistencies while she is filling the record. Furthermore, our method shows \\npromising results in terms of predicting the correct code from the free text fields.  This \\nability can be used to suggest the correct code for the clinician, facilitating and \\naccelerating data entry process. However, this must be done with caution, and only in \\ncases where the prediction precision is extremely high, to avoid encouraging repeating \\nmistakes.  \\nReferences \\n[1] \\nHersh WR, Hickam DH, Leone TJ.

In order to evaluate the usability of protein biomarkers for pre-\\nscreening purposes several different approaches were used, including machine learning algorithms.\\nMethods: All persons involved in the study had diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was diagnosed by capturing 7-\\nfield fundus images, evaluated by two independent ophthalmologists. 165 eyes were examined (from 119 patients),\\n55 were diagnosed healthy and 110 images showed signs of DR. Tear samples were taken from all eyes and state-\\nof-the-art nano-HPLC coupled ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry protein identification was performed on all samples.\\nApplicability of protein biomarkers was evaluated by six different optimally parameterized machine learning\\nalgorithms: Support Vector Machine, Recursive Partitioning, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,\\nK-Nearest Neighbor.\\nResults: Out of the six investigated machine learning algorithms the result of Recursive Partitioning proved to be\\nthe most accurate. The performance of the system realizing the above algorithm reached 74% sensitivity and 48%\\nspecificity.\\nConclusions: Protein biomarkers selected and classified with machine learning algorithms alone are at present not\\nrecommended for screening purposes because of low specificity and sensitivity values.

The initially latent disease could\\nlead to vision loss without any symptoms initially. Timely\\ndiagnosis and therapy however can significantly decelerate\\nits progress, necessitating regular DR screening or appro-\\npriate follow-up in all patients with diabetes. Screening\\ncan be carried out by direct and indirect ophthalmology\\nor increasingly by using photographic methods [2].\\nThe effectiveness of different screening modalities has\\nbeen widely investigated. UK studies show sensitivity\\nlevels for the detection of sight-threatening diabetic ret-\\ninopathy of 41-67% for general practitioners, 48-82% for\\noptometrists, 65% for ophthalmologists, and 27-67% for\\ndiabetologists and hospital physicians using direct oph-\\nthalmoscopy [3,4]. Sensitivity for the detection of refer-\\nable retinopathy by optometrists have been found to be\\n77-100%, with specificity of 94-100% [5].\\nPhotographic methods currently use digital images\\nwith subsequent grading by trained individuals.

The British Diabetic As-\\nsociation (Diabetes UK) has established standard values\\nfor any diabetic retinopathy screening programme of at\\nleast 80% sensitivity and 95% specificity [7,8].\\nRegular DR screening is centralized in several developed\\ncountries due to cost-efficiency and quality control issues\\n[9]. Digital fundus images are captured at the place of pa-\\ntient care and forwarded to a grading center for evaluation\\nby specially trained human graders or ophthalmologists\\n[10]. The system operates with high accuracy but due to\\nits labor intensive nature, it might be poorly scalable in\\neconomically challenged countries [11].\\nIn order to improve scalability and cost-effectiveness,\\nmany research groups are working on developing auto-\\nmated image analysis technologies [12]. Introducing\\nthese technologies in DR screening could substitute first\\nphase examinations performed by human graders. Fol-\\nlowing automated pre-screening, human graders would\\nonly have to examine images that are either questionable\\nor true positive, and potentially carry out quality control\\non a subset of those deemed normal by the software\\n[13]. Preliminary results are promising, sensitivity and\\nspecificity indicators of automated systems are close to\\nthat of human graders [14-16]. An international Retin-\\nopathy Online Challenge is available in order to compare\\nthe results of image processing based algorithms for DR\\nidentification via mycroaneurism detection. The system\\ndeveloped by our team currently performs the best on\\nthis challenge [17].\\nThe aim of this paper is to describe a pilot study,\\nconducted as a first attempt to examine the use of tear\\nfluid proteomics for DR pre-screening. Our hypothesis\\nwas that it is possible to categorize patients with un-\\nknown clinical status into a DR or a non-DR group,\\nbased on the protein pattern identified in the tear fluid\\nsample.\\nTear fluid proteomics\\nBesides computer based image processing other methods\\ncan also support DR screening. Tear fluid proteomics is\\nsuch a possible novel tool for population screening,\\nwhich is based on the pre-screening of a large number\\nof patients and uses human graders only in positive or\\nambiguous cases. The protein composition of tear fluid\\nhas been investigated by numerous research groups and\\nmore than 500 proteins are already proven to be present\\nthere [18,19]. Reports confirm protein profile changes in\\ntear fluid under irregular physiological and pathological\\nconditions (like wound healing or inflammatory diseases\\netc.) [20]. Besides the proteins secreted by the lacrimal\\nglands, tear fluid might contain proteins from epithelial\\ncells covering the eye surface. Furthermore proteins nor-\\nmally residing in the blood can get into the tear fluid\\nthrough increased permeability of the conjunctival ves-\\nsels [21].\\nPhysiological and pathological conditions of the retina\\nalso induce changes in the protein composition of the vit-\\nreous humour, especially when the blood-retinal barrier\\n(BRB) is damaged [22]. Breakdown of the inner endothe-\\nlial BRB, occurs in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macu-\\nlar degeneration, retinal vein occlusions, uveitis and other\\nchronic retinal diseases [23]. DR is a complex disease,\\ncharacterized by vascular alterations, inflammation, and\\nneuronal cell death that involve heat-shock and crystalline\\nproteins. The central mechanism of altered BRB function\\nis a change in the permeability characteristics of retinal\\nendothelial cells caused by elevated levels of growth fac-\\ntors, cytokines, advanced glycation end products, inflam-\\nmation, hyperglycemia and loss of pericytes. Subsequently,\\nparacellular but also transcellular transport across the ret-\\ninal vascular wall increases via opening of endothelial\\nintercellular junctions and qualitative and quantitative\\nchanges in endothelial caveolar transcellular transport, re-\\nspectively. Functional changes in pericytes and astrocytes,\\nas well as structural changes in the composition of the\\nendothelial glycocalyx and the basal lamina around BRB\\nendothelium further facilitate BRB leakage. As Starling's\\nrules apply, active transcellular transport of plasma pro-\\nteins by the BRB endothelial cells causing increased inter-\\nstitial osmotic pressure is probably the main factor in the\\nformation of macular edema [23]. Recent studies using\\nwhole proteome analysis demonstrate that general stress\\nresponse lead to the induction of heat-shock proteins. The\\nalpha-crystallin is expressed in the retina and over-\\nexpressed during diabetes as an adaptive response of ret-\\ninal cells [24]. These changes are more specific to DR than\\nalteration of tear fluid proteome. However, the invasive\\nsampling method makes it difficult to introduce vitreous\\nhumour proteomics in the daily clinical practice.\\nAccording to recent publications the protein compos-\\nition of tear fluid reflects normal or abnormal condi-\\ntions, which justifies the use of tear fluid for screening\\npurposes. Electrophoresis and chromatography also sup-\\nport that protein patterns of healthy and diabetic people\\nare significantly different [25,26].\\nQualitative and quantitative methods used for tear\\nfluid examinations include one and two dimensional\\nelectrophoresis,\\nenzyme-linked\\nimmunosorbent\\nassay\\nand high throughput liquid chromatography [27-29]. Re-\\ncently, high sensitivity and high resolution procedures\\nwere used for the assessment of the effects of trauma\\nand various diseases in tear fluid of microliter quantity.\\nIn these cases, protein profiles were characterized by\\nmass spectrometers MALDI-TOF, SELDI-TOF and LC/\\nMS [30-33].\\nIn a previous study we examined the changes of tear\\nprotein concentrations in DR aiming to identify and\\nTorok et al.

Tear fluid samples were exam-\\nined by quantitative mass spectrometry, and 6 potential\\nbiomarkers namely lipocalin 1, lactotransferrin, lacritin,\\nlysozyme C, lipophilin A and immunoglobulin lambda\\nchain were identified. The results of that study have\\nalready been published elsewhere [34].\\nIn this paper, we evaluate the usefulness of the previ-\\nously identified DR marker proteins in tear fluid sample\\nfor diagnostic purposes and introduce a method based\\non whole protein pattern analysis, which can be inte-\\ngrated into the screening of DR as a pre-screening\\nprocedure.\\nMachine learning\\nMachine learning is an area of artificial intelligence. IT\\nsystems using machine learning methods are capable to\\nlearn from training datasets and predict possible out-\\ncomes based on new observations. In our case the input\\ndata are coming from proteomics experiments and the\\npredicted outcomes are diseased and non-diseased cases\\n(DR or Non-DR). In the learning phase both input data\\nand outcomes are used by the system. During the pre-\\nscreening process the trained machine learning system\\nwill classify cases into diseased or non-diseased groups.\\nIn our pilot study, we intended to ensure the objectiv-\\nity of the assessment by using the following 6 different\\nmachine learning methods: Support Vector Machine\\n(SVM), Recursive Partitioning (rpart), Random Forest\\n(randomForest), Naive Bayes (naïveBayes), Logistic Re-\\ngression (logReg), K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). Possible\\npositive and negative cases for DR can be identified by\\nmachine learning algorithms, allowing the pre-screened\\npopulation\\n(possible\\npositives)\\nto\\nundergo\\nhuman\\nscreening by using digital retinal imaging. The approach\\npresented in this paper is unique in nature, as no previ-\\nous study was found in the scientific literature investi-\\ngating the applicability of tear fluid proteomics based\\nmethods for DR screening.\\nMethods\\nPatient examination\\n119 patients with diabetes were enrolled in the study. In\\ncase of 73 patients one of the eyes were examined due\\nto difficulties in tear fluid sampling (e.g. keratoconjuncti-\\nvitis sicca, operated eye, noncompliance) or because\\nthe\\nretinal image\\ncouldn’t be\\ntaken\\n(e.g.\\ncataract,\\nhemorrhage, angle-closure glaucoma) or assessed (tech-\\nnical difficulties). Diabetic retinopathy was diagnosed by\\ncapturing 7-field fundus images of the patients, evalu-\\nated by two independent ophthalmologists. Megaplus\\nCamera Model 1,6i/10 BIT Zeiss (Carl Zeiss Ophthalmic\\nSystem A6, Jena, Germany) was used for taking images.\\nOut of the 165 eyes examined, 55 were diagnosed\\nhealthy and 110 showed signs of DR. One patient had\\nDR in one eye only.\\nTear fluid samples were collected from the examined\\neyes by a trained assistant under standardized conditions\\n[35]. Tear samples were collected with glass capillaries\\nimmediately before the pupil dilatation for fundus exam-\\nination under slit lamp illumination from the lower tear\\nmeniscus (a horizontal thickening of the pre-corneal tear\\nfilm by the lower margin) at the lateral canthus. Care\\nwas taken not to touch the conjunctiva. The duration of\\nthe sampling process was recorded and the secretion\\nrate was calculated in microl/min, dividing the obtained\\ntear volume by the time of sample collection. Samples\\nused in this investigation had secretion rates of 5–15 μl/\\nmin. Samples were centrifuged (1800 rpm) for 8–10 mi-\\nnutes immediately after sample collection, supernatants\\nwere deep-frozen at −80°C and were thawed only once\\nfor measurements. Tear samples were examined using\\nstate-of-the-art nano-HPLC coupled ESI-MS/MS mass\\nspectrometry protein identification as described elsewhere\\n[29]. During the protein-based screening procedure pre-\\nproliferative and proliferative retinopathy patients were\\nboth considered important, the term ’patient’ includes\\nboth groups diagnosed by using retina images. Global\\npattern of protein concentrations and its changes were\\ndescribed by the examination of the concentrations of\\n34 different proteins.\\nApplication of machine learning methods\\nBy using machine learning algorithms we intended to\\npredict the possible fulfillment of certain future events–\\nusing empirical data containing incomplete information.\\nIn the present special case, input data (features) are pro-\\ntein levels measured in tear fluids from patients with\\ndiabetes and clinical data regarding their DR status (di-\\nchotomous variable of none or some). As the method is\\ndesigned to be used in screening in the future, high sen-\\nsitivity values were considered as the primary criteria for\\nthe construction of the classifier. This was aimed at min-\\nimizing the number of false negative cases, thus redu-\\ncing the chance for missing sight threatening disease.\\nThe goal of this machine learning approach is to assess\\nthe best classification performance achievable by fitting\\ndifferent models to the dataset (model selection). In\\norder to reach the best possible results, we tested several\\nclassifying\\nalgorithms\\n(SVM,\\nrpart,\\nrandomForest,\\nnaiveBayes, logReg, k-NN).\\nA further objective was to design a marker score for\\nmarker selection, targeting the best performance of the\\ntested models. In order to guarantee comparability at\\nthe parameter adjustment of the different classifiers, we\\napplied the settings providing the best performance re-\\ngarding the particular model. In order to monitor the\\nclassifier’s performance on the dataset, the testing was\\nTorok et al. BMC Ophthalmology 2013, 13:40\\nPage 3 of 8\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2415/13/40\\naccomplished with k-fold cross validation procedure\\n[36]. During the k-fold cross validation the data set is di-\\nvided into k equal parts. The first k-1 set (training set) is\\nused for model construction and later on it is tested on\\nthe k-fold set (test set). In the further k-1 iteration the\\nsame procedure is followed, on the first k-2 and k-fold\\nset the model is learning and on the k-1 it is validated.\\nAt the end of the cross validation, the estimate is deter-\\nmined as the mean of the features of the k-fold model.\\nIn this study 5-fold cross validation was used. Standard\\nmeasures were applied to assess the performance of the\\ndifferent models, e.g.: specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, F-\\nmeasure (harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity–as\\na single measure for the performance of the model).\\nData analysis software tools\\nWe collected experimental (proteomics) and clinical\\ndata (DR/Non-DR) in an Excel file which was used as in-\\nput data for the analysis.\\nDuring the data analysis process the R statistical frame-\\nwork and the following packages have been used: Support\\nVector Machine: “e1071”; Recursive Partitioning: “rpart”;\\nRandom Forest: “randomForest”; Naive Bayes: “naiveBayes”;\\nLogistic Regression: “glmnet” and for visualization purpose:\\n“ggplot2” [37]. We have developed our own solution for the\\nK-Nearest Neighbor model.\\nWe ran cross validation using the three different ap-\\nproaches below in order to find the best combination of\\ninput data and the different models.\\nFirst, we used data from all 34 identified proteins for\\nmodel development.\\nHowever, we also wanted to analyze the changes in the\\nperformance of the classifiers if we only use a subset of\\nthe data. Thus, second, only 6 marker proteins (out of\\nthe\\n34)–previously\\nextracted\\nby\\nclassical\\nstatistical\\nmethods–were used for decision making, applying the\\nsix machine learning algorithms. Third, we wanted to\\nfurther evaluate the performance of the models by redu-\\ncing the number of input variables therefore we applied\\nprincipal component analysis (PCA). In this case, we\\nperformed dimension reduction to compress the infor-\\nmation included in the original dataset with principal\\ncomponent analysis and used it for the visualization of\\nthe complex dataset in a 2D plane. With this method\\nthe number of input features could be decreased while\\nas much of the variation in data as possible could be\\nretained. Thus, we had fewer input features which are\\nthe linear combinations of the original variables and\\nuncorrelated with each other.\\nStatement of ethics\\nWe certify that all applicable institutional and govern-\\nmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human\\nTable 1 Performance measures of the six different classifiers\\nModel\\nDataset\\nSENS\\nSPC\\nACC\\nPREC\\nNPV\\nF1\\nLRP\\nLRN\\nnaiveBayes\\norig\\n0.6991\\n0.4186\\n0.6218\\n0.7596\\n0.3462\\n0.7281\\n1.2025\\n0.7188\\nmarker\\n0.8000\\n0.3874\\n0.5064\\n0.3462\\n0.8269\\n0.4832\\n1.3059\\n0.5163\\npca\\n0.6731\\n0.3365\\n0.4487\\n0.3365\\n0.6731\\n0.4487\\n1.0145\\n0.9714\\nkNN\\norig\\n0.6711\\n0.5000\\n0.6667\\n0.9808\\n0.0385\\n0.7969\\n1.3421\\n0.6579\\nmarker\\n0.6688\\n0.5000\\n0.6667\\n0.9904\\n0.0192\\n0.7984\\n1.3377\\n0.6623\\npca\\n0.6643\\n0.3077\\n0.6346\\n0.9135\\n0.0769\\n0.7692\\n0.9596\\n1.0909\\nlogReg\\norig\\n0.6923\\n0.3846\\n0.5897\\n0.6923\\n0.3846\\n0.6923\\n1.1250\\n0.8000\\nmarker\\n0.6615\\n0.3077\\n0.6026\\n0.8269\\n0.1538\\n0.7350\\n0.9556\\n1.1000\\npca\\n0.6623\\n0.0000\\n0.6538\\n0.9808\\n0.0000\\n0.7907\\n0.6623\\nInf\\nrandomForest\\norig\\n0.6929\\n0.4483\\n0.6474\\n0.8462\\n0.2500\\n0.7619\\n1.2559\\n0.6850\\nmarker\\n0.6923\\n0.4103\\n0.6218\\n0.7788\\n0.3077\\n0.7330\\n1.1739\\n0.7500\\npca\\n0.6748\\n0.3636\\n0.6090\\n0.7981\\n0.2308\\n0.7313\\n1.0604\\n0.8943\\nrpart\\norig\\n0.7083\\n0.4722\\n0.6538\\n0.8173\\n0.3269\\n0.7589\\n1.3421\\n0.6176\\nmarker\\n0.7404\\n0.4808\\n0.6538\\n0.7404\\n0.4808\\n0.7404\\n1.4259\\n0.5400\\npca\\n0.6935\\n0.4375\\n0.6410\\n0.8269\\n0.2692\\n0.7544\\n1.2330\\n0.7005\\nSVM\\norig\\n0.6645\\n0.0000\\n0.6603\\n0.9904\\n0.0000\\n0.7954\\n0.6645\\nInf\\nmarker\\n0.6623\\n0.0000\\n0.6538\\n0.9808\\n0.0000\\n0.7907\\n0.6623\\nInf\\npca\\n0.6623\\n0.0000\\n0.6538\\n0.9808\\n0.0000\\n0.7907\\n0.6623\\nInf\\nPerformance measures of the six different classifiers on the different input data: orig-full data set; marker- candidate marker proteins only; pca–PCA transformed\\ndata.

Random Forest method performs slightly worse\\nthan Recursive Partitioning.\\nSix proteins were identified as independent biomarkers\\nout of the 34 candidate protein, by using statistical hy-\\npothesis testing.\\nThere is additional information in the joint distribu-\\ntion of the whole dataset, thus we wanted to examine\\nthe maximum possible performance of the model.\\nOur reason for examining the performance of the re-\\nduced set was to develop a practical method for screen-\\ning, without compromising the performance of the test.\\nWe have found that neither the models built on just\\nthe 6 marker proteins nor the models built on the PCA\\npreprocessed data performed better or worse than the\\nmodels built on the whole protein patterns. After Princi-\\npal Component Analysis the first two components\\nretained 22% of the variation of the original data set.\\nTable 1 shows that in case of retaining the first two com-\\nponents only, performance measures does not change\\nconsiderably. As a visual presentation of the data we\\nhave generated a scatter plot of the first two compo-\\nnents. Figure 1 presents the lack of clear decision\\nboundary separating the two classes.\\nAs part of our descriptive analysis we evaluated and vi-\\nsualized the correlation between the predictor variables\\n(protein levels) and also between predictor and outcome\\nvariables (DR or non-DR) to have a better understanding\\non the structure of the data set. According to the prob-\\nability density function of the correlation values in most\\nof the cases there are low correlation between predictors\\nand predictors/outcomes (Figure 2). These figures sug-\\ngest that the predictors used separately will not be suffi-\\ncient for the classification.\\nFigure 1 Scatter plot. Scatter plot of the PCA transformed data set.

BMC Ophthalmology 2013, 13:40\\nPage 6 of 8\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2415/13/40\\nThe distance of the curves shows a gap between the\\nerror rates of training and test set in case of Support\\nVector\\nMachine\\n(SVM)\\nand\\nRecursive\\nPartitioning\\n(Rpart). This finding suggests that these classifiers have\\nhigh variance and getting more training data might help\\nwith the performance. In case of Logistic Regression\\n(Logreg) and Naive Bayes (naiveBayes) we do not see a\\ngap, but both training and test errors are high, indicating\\nthat the models are too simple, thus, we have underfit\\nthe data.\\nConclusions\\nWe hypothesized at the beginning of the study, that the\\nsystem may be utilized for pre-screening purposes,\\nsubstantially-in long term-reducing the cost of regular\\nscreening and the need for health professionals in the\\nprocess. A possible advantage of this method is that the\\npre-screening of the risk population (i.e. diabetic pa-\\ntients) can be performed at the patient’s home. Patients\\ncan take tear sample by their own, using sampling capil-\\nlaries delivered by post, and then returning it to the la-\\nboratory. Only those with positive screening results\\nshould visit a DR screening center.\\nBased on this pilot study, sensitivity and specificity\\nvalues of the system examined on a test database were\\nnot found high enough to unequivocally support its use\\nas a pre-screening method prior to currently applied\\nscreening procedures. However, the results of the system\\nmay be further improved by the enlargement of the\\nlearning database.\\nAnother promising application of proteomics based\\nmachine learning methods is the support of image pro-\\ncessing based automated methods by improving their\\nperformance to be able to substitute traditional human\\nscreening methods in the future. Given constantly drop-\\nping price of high throughput technologies, methodolo-\\ngies based on such technologies will be available both\\nfor routine point of care diagnostics and screenings [38].\\nOn the other hand, costs of human workforce signifi-\\ncantly increase along with the decreasing accessibility of\\nqualified health care professionals. The net result of\\nthese forces accelerates the future spread of such\\ntechnologies.\\nThis study opens up the possibility of including fea-\\ntures other than protein analysis: e.g. anamnestic clinical\\ndata, results of image processing procedures. Applying\\nmore individual parameters as system inputs may con-\\nsiderably improve the sensitivity indicators of a com-\\nbined system in contrast to the proteomics-alone or\\nimage processing-alone systems. This statement is fur-\\nther emphasized as the results of procedures based on\\nimage processing are highly promising. The system built\\non combined procedures may be applied in the future\\nclinical practice.\\nCompeting interests\\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\nAuthors’ contributions\\nZST carried out the initiation of the research, management and manuscript\\nwriting.

Introduction\\nIntermittent claudication [1] is a walking symptom. Patients\\nwith intermittent claudication suffer from lower limb pain\\nafter a walking for a short time. However, rest relieves the\\npain and allows the patient to walk again. As intermittent\\nclaudication involves trouble walking, patients often consult\\nan orthopedic surgeon, and the number of such consultations\\nhas recently increased markedly [2]. Unfortunately, inter-\\nmittent claudication is predominantly caused by not 1 but\\n2 different diseases: LSS (lumber spinal canal stenosis) and\\nPAD (peripheral arterial disease). Toribatake et al. [1–3] noted\\nthat PAD and LSS produce similar symptoms and emphasized\\nthe significance of their differential diagnosis. Therefore, it is\\nclinically very important (especially for orthopedic surgeons)\\nto identify the causative disease of intermittent claudication.\\nAmong the types of LSS, we focused on the L4 and L5\\nsubtypes, which cause radicular symptoms that are mainly\\nresponsible for intermittent claudication in patients with LSS;\\nthese subtypes of LSS are difficult to differentiate from PAD\\n[1]. For this disease, L4 and L5 indicate the vertebral level\\naffected by stenosis.\\nThere are 2 categories of examinations for differentiating\\nbetween these conditions. Some examinations are simple\\nbut imprecise and often fail to differentiate the underlying\\ndiseases; 2 examples are palpation and observation of stand-\\ning posture. The other examinations are precise but invasive\\nand expensive; some examples are angiography, myelography,\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measurement of the\\nankle brachial index (ABI) [4]. Furthermore, these exam-\\ninations require highly skilled professionals and precision\\ninstruments. Such complicated and expensive examinations\\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\\ne Scientiﬁc World Journal\\nVolume 2014, Article ID 861529, 10 pages\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/861529\\n2\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\nare difficult to conduct at small hospitals and clinics. Fur-\\nthermore, their high cost is undesirable for the patient. The\\noptimal differentiation method would be an examination that\\nused a minimal number of simple instruments and could be\\neasily performed even by nonspecialists. Notably, the affected\\nparts of the legs differ between the causative diseases and\\ncould thus produce kinematical differences in patients’ gait\\npatterns.\\nIn this context, this study was performed to develop a new\\ndifferentiation methodology utilizing minimally required\\ndata; simple walking motion data. The key features of this\\nmethodology are as follows.\\n(1) The Differentiation Is Based on Minimally Required Walk-\\ning Motion Data. Aiming at the usage in small hospitals or\\nat home, the differentiation was designed to use only the\\n2-dimensional gait pattern in the sagittal plane from the\\nsimple walking motion analysis. This presented a challenge.\\nAdditional advantages of the system are easy set-up and\\ncalibration, a short duration of measurement, and usability\\nin a narrow space and a noncontrolled environment by\\nnonspecialists.\\n(2) SVM (Support Vector Machine) [5, 6] Classifier-Based\\nMethodology with a High Rate of Accuracy. There is no\\nresearch focusing on differentiating between PAD and LSS\\nusing gait feature analysis except for our own previous reports\\n[3, 7]. We present an SVM classifier-based methodology\\nwhich is an extended version of one-versus-the-rest multi-\\nclass SVM classifier. Leave-one-out cross-validation showed a\\nhigh rate of accuracy (83% in total) for differentiating among\\nthe normal (normal healthy individuals), PAD, L4, and L5\\ngroups.\\n(3) Derivation of Medically Meaningful Differentiation Fea-\\ntures Available for Visual Examination. The key for obtain-\\ning differentiation with high accuracy is how to con-\\nstruct/select the features, that is, the input to classi-\\nfiers. Our own previous reports [3, 7] show that differ-\\nent diseases produce kinematical differences in gait pat-\\nterns. Focusing on this fact, we select/produce kinemati-\\ncal features in gait patterns for the differentiation. Addi-\\ntional advantage is that because these features are visually\\ndetectable and medically meaningful/consistent, these fea-\\ntures are also available for a medical interview or visual\\nexamination.\\nRelated Works. We have conducted the only studies thus far\\nto use gait analysis to differentiate between patients with\\nLSS and PAD [3, 7]. The present study differs from our past\\nreports [3, 7] in its inclusion of the presented classification\\nmethodology and the results thereof as well as in the added\\ndifferentiation features (amplitude of the femur angle, maxi-\\nmally contracted muscle length of the gastrocnemius muscle\\nfrom the reference model, and maximally relaxed muscle\\nlength of the quadriceps muscle from the reference model).\\nIf we do not restrict ourselves to differentiation of the causes\\nof intermittent claudication, there have been a number of\\nstudies concerning the analysis of intermittent claudication\\nand the classification of gait patterns. Here, we briefly review\\nthem.\\nGait Analysis of Patients with LSS. Suda et al. [8] evaluated\\nthe improvement in gait after surgical treatment of patients\\nwith neurogenic intermittent claudication. Papadakis et al.\\n[9] compared the gait patterns of healthy people with those\\nof patients with LSS; they also evaluated the postoperative\\nprogression of the gait pattern of patients with LSS [10] and\\nshowed that the variability of the gait decreased relatively to\\nthe preoperative gait pattern. Yokogawa et al. [11] compared\\ngait patterns between patients with lumbar spinal canal\\nstenosis (L4 radiculopathy) and those with osteoarthritis of\\nthe hip and found several differences.\\nGait Analysis of Patients with PAD. Scherer et al. [12] com-\\npared the gait patterns of healthy people with those of patients\\nwith PAD and found several distinctive characteristics of the\\npatients’ walking gaits. Myers et al. [13] compared the gait\\npatterns of patients with PAD before and after the onset of\\npain and found the gait to differ only at the ankle joint.\\nGardner et al. [14] compared the gait patterns of healthy\\npeople with those of patients with PAD and found differences\\nin walking parameters such as the walking speed, stride\\nlength, and swing and stance times.\\nClassification of Gait Patterns. The gait analysis methods used\\nfor classification have been summarized previously [15, 16].\\nWang et al. [17] presented a decision tree-based algorithm for\\nclassifying human walking motion/behavior. Kamruzzaman\\nand Begg [18] identified and classified children with a cerebral\\npalsy-related gait via an SVM-based method. Mezghani et al.\\n[19] derived features and constructed a classifier for distin-\\nguishing asymptomatic from knee osteoarthritis-affected gait\\npatterns.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\nHere, the methodology for obtaining gait pattern, the\\nextracted features, and the SVM classifier-based methodol-\\nogy for the differentiation are described.\\n2.1. Methodology for Obtaining Gait Pattern\\n2.1.1. Participants. The participants were 13 normal healthy\\nindividuals (5 men and 8 women), 10 patients with PAD\\n(9 men and 1 woman), 13 patients with L5 LSS (4 men\\nand 9 women), and 10 patients with L4 LSS (6 men and\\n4 women). The group to which each participant belonged\\nwas determined by his or her medical diagnosis, which was\\nestablished by the medical doctors among the authors. The\\ndiagnoses were made from comprehensive consideration of\\nthe patients’ clinical features; radiological findings; surgical\\nfindings; MRI, magnetic resonance angiography, ABI, and\\ncontrast-enhanced computed tomography results; and the\\neffects of selective nerve root blocks.

Motion Capture. Figure 1 shows the walking motion\\nmeasurement system. As simplicity was one of our require-\\nments, we constructed the system to obtain 2-dimensional\\ngait patterns and aimed to derive the differentiation features\\nand differentiate the diseases using the minimum amount\\nof information. We constructed the measurement system as\\nsimply as possible, with easy set-up and calibration, to allow\\nits use in small hospitals even by a few nonspecialized medical\\npersonnel. Other aims were a short duration of measurement,\\nability to obtain measurements in a narrow space, and ability\\nto obtain measurements in a noncontrolled environment.\\nWe measured the participants’ gait patterns using light-\\nemitting diode (LED) markers and had them walk on the\\ntreadmill in semidarkness so that the LED marker posi-\\ntions could be easily captured. Semidarkness can convert a\\nnoncontrolled environment into a controlled environment.\\nWe placed handmade LED markers on each participant’s\\nacromion, anterior superior iliac, fibular head, lateral malleo-\\nlus, and fifth metatarsal head. Figure 2(a) shows the definition\\nof the coordinate frame and the marker positions. Note that\\nthe right side is forward in Figure 2. The LED markers were\\nattached to the impaired leg. The participants practiced walk-\\ning on the treadmill before the experiment for safety and to\\ndetermine the appropriate treadmill speed. The latter was set\\nto allow the participant to walk normally. The measurement\\nwas stopped if the participant felt pain. For safety, medical\\ndoctors stood by and watched each participant so that they\\ncould immediately stop the treadmill and help the participant\\nin the event of an accident. We used a commercially available\\ncamera with a frame rate of 30 frames/s. Note that the\\nobtained angle values were only used for analysis and that no\\ncalibration (such as measurement of leg length) was required\\nor conducted.\\n2.1.3. Analysis. The angles used for analysis are shown in\\nFigure 2(b). We detected the marker positions using our own\\nalgorithm [3] based on an LK (Lucas-Kanade) filter [20]. We\\nderived the angles from the marker positions. Note that the\\nangles are not identical to the actual joint angles because they\\nare mapped on the sagittal plane, and we therefore renamed\\nthem according to our own system. The mean data for 1 cycle\\nof gait pattern were analyzed. The accuracy of this system\\ndepends on the resolution of the camera and the distance\\nbetween the treadmill and camera and was from 0.007 to 0.04\\n[rad] for our set-up.\\n2.2. Extracted Features. Our goal was to identify the causative\\ndisease of intermittent claudication. As described previously,\\nthe candidate diseases are PAD and 2 varieties of LSS, L5 and\\nL4. We also included a number of normal healthy participants\\nas a control group. In order to get the features, that is,\\nthe input variables for classifiers, we extract the features\\nof gait pattern in the 4 groups; normal, PAD, L5, and L4.\\nTable 1 shows the list of the extracted features, including the\\ninformation about which features are used in the presented\\nSVM classifier-based methodology described in Section 2.3.\\nFocusing on the characteristic of each disease such as the\\nareas where disruption of sensation and ischemia occur, we\\nextracted the features associated with the motions of the\\nangles of single joints. We remark about how to the knee\\nangle at the start of the stance phase. The start of the stance\\nphase was defined as the time at which the 𝑥 component of\\nthe marker attached to the fifth metatarsal head was maximal.\\nThe time at which the foot reaches its most forward position is\\nnot always identical to the start of the true stance phase, which\\nit may precede. Therefore, we define that the knee angle at the\\nstart of the stance phase is the mean of the values of the knee\\nangles from 4 frames before the start of the stance phase to\\nthe start of the stance phase. Letting 𝑞3(𝑘) be the knee angle\\nat 𝑡 = 𝑘 and 𝑘ss be the time at which the stance phase started,\\nwe calculated the mean 𝑞3(𝑘) from 𝑡 = 𝑘ss − 4 to 𝑡 = 𝑘ss. This\\nwas recorded as the value of the knee angle at the start of the\\nstance phase.\\nThe analysis of the angles of single joints corresponds to\\nanalysis of monoarticular muscles. However, there are also\\nmuscles that influence the angles of 2 adjacent joints, and\\nit may be possible to derive features associated with these\\nbiarticular muscles. Therefore, we also extracted the features\\nassociated with biarticular muscles. Individual differences in\\nbody size make direct comparison of muscle lengths illogical;\\ntherefore, we used a reference model based on the bone\\nlengths of the actual human skeleton model in our laboratory.\\nWe based the sites of attachment of the muscles to the\\nbones in the reference model on anatomical data [21, 22].\\nFigure 3 shows the resulting reference model. We focused\\non the gastrocnemius muscle where it is considered to be\\nthe affected area for PAD, and the quadriceps muscle where\\nit is considered to be the affected area for L4. The input\\nfor this model was the knee and ankle (upper body, femur,\\nand knee) angles of a given participant and the output was\\nthe length of the gastrocnemius (quadriceps) muscle in the\\nreference model. The value thus derived differed from the\\nparticipant’s actual muscle length but could be compared with\\nthose of the other participants. We therefore let the muscle\\nlength derived from the model represent the participant’s\\nmuscle length. These values could thus be said to represent\\nnormalized muscle lengths.\\n4\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\nAcromion\\nAnterior superior iliac \\nHead of the fibula \\nLateral malleolus  \\nThe fifth metatarsal head \\nx\\ny\\n(a) Marker positions\\nAnkle angle\\nKnee angle\\nFemur angle\\nUpper body angle\\nx\\ny\\n(b) Angles\\nFigure 2: Coordinate frame, marker positions, and angles.\\nFoot\\nGastrocnemius stop position\\n370mm\\nGastrocnemius\\n50mm\\n40mm\\nGastrocnemius start position\\n𝜃3 (knee angle)\\n𝜃4 (ankle angle)\\n(a) Reference model for the gastrocnemius muscle\\nRectus femoris\\nRectus femoris start position\\nPatella\\n40mm\\n40mm\\n440mm\\nRectus femoris stop position\\n𝜃3 (knee angle)\\nRectus femoris passage position\\n60mm\\n𝜃1(upper body angle) + 𝜃2(femur angle)\\n(b) Reference model for quadriceps muscle\\nFigure 3: Reference models for calculating normalized biarticular muscle lengths.\\n2.3. SVM Classifier-Based Methodology for the Differentiation\\n2.3.1. Methodology Based on the Support Vector Machine\\n(SVM). We will first introduce SVM [23–25]. SVM was\\noriginally a binary (2-class) classifier. Consider the given data\\nset (x1, 𝑦1), . . . , (x𝑚, 𝑦𝑚), where x𝑖 ∈ R𝑛 and 𝑦𝑖 ∈ {−1, 1}\\nis labeled for x𝑖. Then, we solve the following quadratic\\nfunction:\\nmin\\nw,𝑏,𝜉\\n1\\n2w𝑇w + 𝐶\\n𝑚\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n𝜉𝑖\\nSubject to 𝑦𝑖 (w𝑇𝜙 (x) + 𝑏) ≥ 1 − 𝜉𝑖\\n𝜉𝑖 ≥ 0.\\n(1)\\nHere, the function 𝜙 maps data x𝑖 to the higher-\\ndimensional feature space 𝜙 : R𝑛\\n→\\nF. The following\\nhyperplane in the feature space splits the data into the 2\\nlabeled classes:\\n𝑓 (x) = w𝑇𝜙 (x) + 𝑏,\\n(2)\\nwhere w and 𝑏 are the parameters that specify the linear\\nhyperplane. This can provide a nonlinear boundary for the\\n2 labeled classes in the original data space. Note that the\\nhyperplane containing 𝑦𝑖(w𝑇𝜙(x) + 𝑏) = 1 − 𝜉𝑖 is called the\\nsupport vector. 𝜉𝑖 is termed the slack variable, and its solution\\ngives the maximal margin for classification error. 𝐶 &gt; 0 is\\nthe parameter controlling the tradeoff between the number of\\nmisclassified data points in the training and the separation of\\nthe remaining data with the maximal margin. The function 𝜙\\nconstructs a kernel function such as 𝐾(x𝑖, x𝑗) = 𝜙(x𝑖)𝑇 𝜙(x𝑖).\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\n5\\nThe following are well-known candidates for the kernel\\nfunction:\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = x𝑇\\n𝑖 x𝑗\\nlinear,\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = (𝛾x𝑇\\n𝑖 x𝑗 + 𝑟)\\n𝑑,\\n𝛾 &gt; 0\\npolynomial,\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = exp (𝛾󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩x𝑖 − x𝑗\\n󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩\\n2) ,\\n𝛾 &gt; 0\\nRBF,\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = tanh (𝛾x𝑇\\n𝑖 x𝑗 + 𝑟)\\nsigmoid,\\n(3)\\nwhere 𝛾, 𝑟, and 𝑑 are kernel parameters and RBF is the radial\\nbasis function. Given test data x𝑡, the classifying decision is\\nmade by\\nsgn (𝑓 (x𝑡)) = sgn (w𝑇𝜙 (x𝑡) + 𝑏) .\\n(4)\\nThe goal of our differentiation was to determine to which\\nof the normal, PAD, L5, and L4 groups a given (test) dataset\\nbelongs. Therefore, a 4-class classifier was needed. The binary\\nSVM classifier can be extended to a multiclass classifier [23,\\n25, 26]. There are 2 main approaches to constructing a 𝑘-class\\nSVM. The first is to train the binary classifier with regard to\\nall combinations (totaling 𝑘(𝑘 − 1)/2). If test data are given,\\nwe apply the 𝑘(𝑘 − 1)/2 classifiers to it and decide the final\\noutput by voting, with the most-voted class being the final\\noutput. This method is called one-versus-one (OVO). The\\nother approach is to train a 𝑘-independent binary classifier\\nby training the 𝑖th classifier to regard the 𝑖th class as the class\\nwith the positive label and the remaining classes as the class\\nwith the negative label. The 𝑖th classifier decision is made by\\nsgn (𝑓𝑖 (x𝑡)) = sgn (w𝑇\\n𝑖 𝜙 (x𝑡) + 𝑏𝑖) .\\n(5)\\nThe overall decision is made by\\n𝑖 = argmax\\n𝑖\\n𝑓𝑖 (x𝑡) .\\n(6)\\nThis approach is called one-versus-the-rest (OVR).\\nPresented Methodology. Not all features are always suitable for\\ndifferentiating a certain group from the other groups (see the\\ndata for the features shown in Figures 4∼12). In this case, a\\nvoting-based method, which does not take the magnitude of\\nthe possibility value into account (but instead provides 0 or\\n1), does not always work well. With this in mind, we present\\na differentiation methodology based on OVR. Other merits\\nof OVR are that it is simple and first-running and that it is\\neasy to optimize the parameters for the classifications. The\\nmethodology is as follows.\\nTraining. We trained 4 binary classifiers, each of which was for\\nclassifying 1 class versus the other classes: (1) normal versus\\nthe other groups, (2) PAD versus the other groups, (3) L5\\nversus the other groups, and (4) L4 versus the other groups.\\nWe selected appropriate features for every binary classifier\\nbased on the significant differences described in Section 3.\\nThe features selected are shown in Table 1.

First, the corresponding features of the given\\ntest/sample (walking motion) data were calculated. Using\\nthese features, we calculated the decision value 𝑓𝑖(x𝑡) (5) for\\neach classifier. Then, from (6), we obtained the final output.\\n3. Results and Discussion\\n3.1. Features Associated with the Motions of the Angles of Single\\nJoints. We first investigated the features associated with the\\nmotions of the angles of single joints. Figures 4, 5, and 6 show\\nthe results.\\n3.1.1. Mean Ankle Angle. Figure 4 shows that the ankle angle\\nwas larger in the PAD group and smaller in the L5 group\\nthan in the normal and L4 groups and differed significantly\\nbetween the PAD and L5 groups according to the Tukey-\\nKramer method. A multiclass classification such as the\\nSVM (OVR) generally requires classification/differentiation\\nbetween a given group and all other groups, so the most useful\\nfeatures are those that are largest or smallest for a certain\\n(target) group. Therefore, the mean ankle angle appeared\\nuseful for differentiating either PAD or L5 from the other\\ngroups.\\nPatients with PAD are susceptible to ischemia of the\\ntriceps surae muscles and therefore move to prevent the\\ncollapse and stenosis of the blood vessels inside these muscles.\\nThe patient attempts to keep the radii of the blood vessels\\nlarge in order to minimize the loss of blood flow and thus\\navoid muscle ischemia. To accomplish this, the patient with\\nPAD tends to keep the angle of the ankle large at all times. In\\ncontrast, patients with LSS (L5) have disruption of sensation\\naround the tibialis anterior muscle and the bottom surface of\\nthe foot. This increases the risk for collision between the tip of\\n6\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\nTable 1: Extracted features for differentiating among normal, PAD, L5 and L4, and which features are used in the presented SVM classifier-\\nbased methodology.

These trends are considered to produce large mean\\nankle angle in PAD group while small in L5 group.\\n3.1.2. Knee Angle at the Start of the Stance Phase. Figure 5\\nshows that this feature is large in the L4 group, although\\nthe difference was not significant in Tukey-Kramer method;\\nhowever, when we conducted t tests for each pair, we obtained\\nsignificant differences between L4 and the other groups,\\nshown in Figure 4 by the dashed lines.

The large knee angle at the start\\nof the stance phase is consistent with this observation. The\\nvalue was close to 180∘, indicating that the knee is extended as\\nmuch as possible.

We first considered the values for the length of\\nthe gastrocnemius muscle. Both the maximally relaxed and\\nmaximally contracted lengths increased from the PAD to\\nthe L4 to the L5 group. Only the normal group showed a\\ndifferent tendency, consistent with the results for the range\\nof motion. Statistically significant differences were evident\\nbetween many of the groups. The small values of every feature\\nin the PAD group were consistent with the hypothesis that\\nthe patient keeps the length of the gastrocnemius muscle\\nshort. On the other hand, the large maximally relaxed and\\ncontracted muscle lengths and small range of motion in the\\nLSS (L5) group support the hypothesis that the patient keeps\\nthe angle of the ankle small and avoids lifting up the legs. The\\nmaximally relaxed length appeared useful for differentiating\\nPAD or L5 from the other groups, whereas the maximally\\ncontracted length appeared useful for differentiating L5 from\\nthe other groups. The range of motion was significantly\\ngreater in the normal group than in all other groups and\\nwould therefore be useful for differentiating the normal group\\nfrom the other groups.\\nWe next considered the values for the length of the\\nquadriceps muscle. The maximally contracted length was\\nsmallest in the L4 group, although the differences were slight.\\nThis corresponds to the hypothesis that patients with L4\\nLSS keep the quadriceps muscle contracted, especially during\\nlanding. The range of motion was larger in the normal and L4\\ngroups and smaller in the L5 group. This was attributed to the\\ntendency of patients with L5 LSS to avoid lifting up their legs,\\nas described above. This feature appeared potentially useful\\nfor differentiating between the L4 and normal groups and\\nthe other groups but more useful for differentiating the L5\\ngroup from the other groups.

We used leave-\\none-out cross-validation for the evaluation. Note that we used\\nnormalized data for input to every classifier. We remark about\\nthe implantation of SVM. The implantation was conducted\\nbased on LIBSVM [24]. The RBF was chosen as the kernel\\nfunction. The values for the 2 parameters 𝐶 and 𝛾 for the\\nclassifications were determined by a grid search [24]. The\\ngrid search finds good values by evaluating (e.g., from cross-\\nvalidation results) exponentially increasing values of 𝐶 and 𝛾\\n(such as 𝐶 = 2−5, 2−3, . . . , 𝛾 = 2−5, 2−3, . . .). Note that in the\\npresented methodology, we applied the grid search to each\\nclassifier separately because the features used in each classifier\\nwere different.\\nTable 2 shows the classification results about total accu-\\nracy in every classifier.

Conclusion\\nIntermittent claudication is caused mainly by 2 different\\ndiseases, LSS (lumber spinal canal stenosis) and PAD (periph-\\neral arterial disease). LSS can be subdivided into L4 and\\nL5 disease. The medical treatments for these conditions\\nare completely different, making their differentiation very\\nimportant. At present, the diagnosis is made by analyzing\\nmany results from many examinations, including sophisti-\\ncated methods such as MRI. This methodology is available\\nonly at well-equipped hospitals. With this in mind, this paper\\npresents a novel SVM-based methodology for differentiating\\namong normal healthy people and patients with PAD, L4,\\nand L5 utilizing minimally required data, simple walking\\nmotion data. The simple walking measurement system was\\nconstructed to obtain 2-dimensional gait patterns in the\\nsagittal plane and is intended for use at small hospitals or\\nat home. The system’s other key features are easy set-up\\nand calibration, a short duration of measurement, usability\\nin a narrow space by nonspecialists, and ability to obtain\\nmeasurements in a noncontrolled environment. From the gait\\npatterns, we then extracted several visually detectable and\\nmedically meaningful/consistent differentiation features that\\nare also available for a medical interview or visual exam-\\nination. The extracted features can largely be categorized\\ninto 2 groups: those associated with the angles of single\\njoints (monoarticular muscles) and those associated with the\\nangles of 2 adjacent joints (biarticular muscles). We used\\nthe derived differentiation features to construct an SVM-\\n(support vector machine-) based differentiation method.\\nThe differentiation/classification was developed successfully\\nand yielded a total accuracy of 83% in leave-one-out cross-\\nvalidation. The accuracy of the differentiation/classification\\nwas lower for identification of patients with L4. Our future\\nwork will focus on improving the accuracy of this diagnostic\\nmethod.\\nConflict of Interests\\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\\nregarding the publication of this paper.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank Ms. Yui Sano and Mr. Shinji\\nHabe for helping with analysis of gait pattern data.\\nReferences\\n[1] Y.

There is a need for novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ccRCC, due to its\\nheterogeneous molecular profiles and asymptomatic early stage. This study aims to develop classification\\nmodels to distinguish early stage and late stage of ccRCC based on gene expression profiles. We employed\\nsupervised learning algorithms- J48, Random Forest, SMO and Naïve Bayes; with enriched model learning by fast\\ncorrelation based feature selection to develop classification models trained on sequencing based gene\\nexpression data of RNAseq experiments, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas.\\nResults: Different models developed in the study were evaluated on the basis of 10 fold cross validations and\\nindependent dataset testing. Random Forest based prediction model performed best amongst the models developed\\nin the study, with a sensitivity of 89%, accuracy of 77% and area under Receivers Operating Curve of 0.8.\\nConclusions: We anticipate that the prioritized subset of 62 genes and prediction models developed in this study\\nwill aid experimental oncologists to expedite understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stage progression\\nand discovery of prognostic factors for ccRCC tumors.\\nBackground\\nRenal cell carcinoma is a common adult kidney cancer,\\naccounting for 2-3% of all new cancer cases diagnosed\\nworldwide [1]. Detection of renal cell carcinoma at an\\nearly stage is difficult and generally diagnosed incidentally\\n[2]. Most cases can be treated effectively only if detected\\ntimely, increasing the survival rates of patients [3]. The\\nclear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most\\ncommon subtype of the renal cell carcinoma, character-\\nized by clear cell morphology of the cytoplasm [4]. So\\nfar, early stage diagnosis is difficult due to the molecular\\ncomplexity and divergent clinical behavior of ccRCC\\npatients [5]. Hence, there is an urgent need to determine\\ncandidate biomarkers for diagnosis and/or prognosis for\\nstage specific distinction in ccRCC.\\nAdvancements in high throughput technologies like\\nNext Generation Sequencing have opened novel avenues\\nin cancer research with renewed emphasis on diagnosis,\\nprognosis and therapeutics. The launch of large scale\\ncomprehensive multi-node programs like International\\nCancer Genomic consortium [ICGC] (http://icgc.org/) and\\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] (http://cancergenome.\\nnih.gov/) enables systematic studies on genomic, epige-\\nnomic and transcriptomic levels for different cancer types\\nthat hold clinical and societal importance globally [6].\\nThese projects are making data available to researchers in\\ndifferent levels 1, 2, 3, 4 (i.e. raw, processed, interpreted\\n* Correspondence: dinesh@icgeb.res.in\\nBioinformatics Laboratory, Structural and Computational Biology Group,\\nInternational Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB),\\nAruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India\\nJagga and Gupta BMC Proceedings 2014, 8(Suppl 6):S2\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/8/S6/S2\\n© 2014 Jagga and Gupta; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In order to analyze\\ndiverse and multidimensional cancer related data, machine\\nlearning techniques are being extensively applied for\\ncancer prognosis as well as diagnosis [9,10].\\nIn ccRCC, clinical tumor staging by TNM staging\\nsystem is used - as prognostic factor; determines treatment\\nregimen of patient; confirmed to guide the surveillance\\nprotocols and to assess risk of metastatic renal cell\\ncarcinoma [3,11-13]. Although tumor stage being an effec-\\ntive prognostic factor, to our knowledge there has been no\\nsystematic studies characterizing gene expression data for\\ntumor stage progression. Thereby, we hypothesized that\\nidentifying gene expression signature that correlates with\\nclinical tumor stage progression might lead to discovery of\\na panel of prognostic molecular signatures for ccRCC\\ntumors.\\nIn this study, we have developed prediction models to\\ndiscriminate clinical tumor stages- early stage (I, II) and\\nlate stage (III, IV) of ccRCC. The prediction models are\\ntrained on gene expression data of RNAseq experiments\\nfrom TCGA by implementing state-of-art supervised\\nmachine learning algorithms. The gene expression signa-\\ntures identified by feature selection approach, which\\nenriched classifier training, helped us to efficiently classify\\nthe tumors based on their clinical tumor stage. Further,\\nwe found that amongst the implemented machine learn-\\ning techniques, predictive models based on Random\\nForest algorithm performed the best with accuracy of\\n76.84% on independent data test, area under Receiver\\nOperating Characteristic Curve (auROC) of 0.778.\\nMethods\\nThe overall methodology followed in the article is\\nsummarized in Figure 1.\\nData mining\\nThe dataset for this study was downloaded from TCGA\\ndata portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcga-\\nHome2.jsp). The Level 3 RNAseq expression dataset\\nfrom cancer type KIRC i.e. Kidney Renal clear cell carci-\\nnoma on Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA sequencing plat-\\nform was obtained from TCGA data portal [14]. The\\nRNAseq expression data was available for 475 tumor\\nsamples. Each patient gene expression profile consists of\\ngene expression data for 20,534 genes. Only tumor sam-\\nples were taken into account in the study. The clinical\\ninformation for selected subjects was retrieved from the\\n“clinical Biotab” section of the data matrix based on the\\nBCR (Biospecimen Core Resource) IDs of the patients.\\nWe generated a gene expression data matrix in Comma\\nSeparated Value (CSV) file format from the data retrieved\\nfrom the TCGA data portal, with 20,534 genes as column\\nlabels and 475 patients BCR ids as row labels. This was\\nachieved using in-house shell scripts. The ‘Reads Per\\nKilobase per Million’ i.e. RPKM values of the mapped\\nreads, retrieved as an estimate for gene expression, were\\nused as feature vectors for classifiers trainings. In order to\\ngenerate a study dataset, we marked class label of “Early\\nStage” for patients with clinical tumor stage I &amp; II, and\\nclass labels of “Late Stage” for tumor stage III &amp; IV.\\nTesting and Training dataset gene expression matrix\\nwith 9756650 (20,534 × 475) data points was randomly\\nstratified and split into 80% training-cum-validation data-\\nset (Additional File 2) and 20% independent testing dataset\\n(Additional File 3) using a PERL script, developed in\\nhouse.\\nMachine learning\\nAll the Machine learning steps including data pre-\\nprocessing, feature selection, generating classification\\nmodels and independent testing was performed on\\nWaikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA)\\nversion 3.7.9 [15].\\nFeature selection: For reducing the dimensionality in\\nfeature space and improving instance to feature ratio for\\nbetter machine learning, we combined WEKA attribute\\nevaluator ‘SymmetricalUncertAttributeSetEval’ with\\nsearch method of ‘FCBFSearch’. The algorithm Fast\\nCorrelation Based Feature (FCBF) selection utilizes pre-\\ndominant correlation to identify relevant features in high\\ndimensional datasets [16]. This feature selection method\\nis used in conjunction with evaluator ‘Symmetrical\\nUncert Attribute Eval’, which selects subset of features\\nbased on symmetrical uncertainty with respect to another\\nfeatures [16,17].\\nWe then analyzed this subset gene list for Gene Ontol-\\nogy (GO)- biological process annotations with WebGestalt\\n(http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/), a Web-based\\nGene Set Analysis Toolkit [18]. We visualized the impact\\nof our candidate genes at genomic (mutation, copy\\nnumber alterations), transcriptomic (expression) and\\nprotein levels (expression) in ccRCC TCGA dataset\\nthrough cBio Cancer Genomics Portal [19,20]. We also\\nestimated overall Kaplan-Meier Survival curve based on\\ncases with and without alteration in these genes using\\ncBio Cancer Genomics Portal.\\nClassification algorithms\\nWe employed four different state-of-the-art supervised\\nmachine learning algorithms (J48, Naïve Bayes, Sequential\\nminimal optimization and Random Forest) for generating\\nthe classification models. J48 is the java based implemen-\\ntation decision tree learning algorithm C4.5 [21]. Naïve\\nJagga and Gupta BMC Proceedings 2014, 8(Suppl 6):S2\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/8/S6/S2\\nPage 2 of 7\\nBayes algorithm works on the assumption that all the fea-\\ntures are statistically independent and is based on Bayes\\ntheorem [22]. Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)\\nalgorithm is an implementation of Support Vector Classi-\\nfier [23,24]. Random Forest is randomly constructed\\nensemble of independent decision trees [25].\\nTraining-cum-validation: The four supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms (J48, LibSVM, Naïve Bayes, and Ran-\\ndom Forest) were trained on the subset features from fea-\\nture selection and further validated by 10 fold cross-\\nvalidation. The training models thus generated were com-\\npared based on the accuracy and auROC. Random Forest\\nclassifier was optimized for number of trees and the mod-\\nels were generated using number of trees as 1000.\\nIndependent dataset test: Independent data testing is\\nrecommended to exclude the “memory” effect or bias for\\ntrained classification models [26]. So, we re-evaluated the\\nperformance of best-trained and cross-validated model on\\nindependent dataset.\\nPerformance evaluation\\nIn order to evaluate the generated prediction models we\\nemployed various evaluation metrics recommended for\\nevaluating the classifier’s performances i.e. accuracy,\\nsensitivity or recall, specificity, Matthews Correlation\\nCoefficient (MCC), F-value and auROC [27,28]. The\\nauROC is area under curve and is evaluated for compar-\\ning performance of several classifiers.\\nFigure 1 Schematic representation of the overall strategy used in the study. Data was downloaded from TCGA data portal. Gene\\nexpression values of the tumors constituted the descriptor values. Class labels were derived from the clinical information given in the Biotab of\\nthe TCGA data portal. Resulting data was processed to generate training/testing data files. Feature selection and generation of classification\\nmodels was performed on WEKA Workbench.\\nJagga and Gupta BMC Proceedings 2014, 8(Suppl 6):S2\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/8/S6/S2\\nPage 3 of 7\\nResults\\nGene expression data matrix\\nThe RNAseq dataset for 475 clinically diagnosed ccRCC\\npatients were retrieved from TCGA data portal. The data-\\nset includes gene expression levels for 20,534 genes in\\ntumor tissue samples of the patients. Thus, we generated a\\nstudy dataset of gene expression data matrix of 20,534 ×\\n475, columns and rows respectively. The data characteris-\\ntics of patients whose gene expression values have been\\nused in this study are given as Additional File 1. Further,\\nthe study dataset was divided into 80% training-cum-\\nvalidation and 20% independent testing dataset. The distri-\\nbution of patients across training and testing dataset by\\nclinical tumor stage is given in Table 1.\\nFeature selection\\nFeature selection performed on training-cum-validation\\ndataset of 219 early stage and 161 late stage instances\\nby fast correlation based feature selection largely\\nreduced the feature vectors space from 20,534 genes to\\n62 genes (see additional files: 4 for list of genes, 5 for\\ndistribution plot of the expression values for all the\\nselected 62 genes). From the GO Slim Annotation of\\nsubset genes, we identified “multicellular organismal\\nprocess” (29 genes), “response to stimulus” (28 genes),\\n“metabolic process” (26 genes) and “biological regula-\\ntion” (26 genes) as most frequent GO annotations for\\nBiological Processes (Additional file 6). Oncoprint of the\\n62 identified candidate gene list by feature selection\\ndetermined the alterations of genomic profiles in 83.6%\\nof ccRCC cases (Additional file 6). Further validation of\\nthe relevance of selected gene features was achieved by\\nperforming survival Kaplan-Meir estimate. The survival\\nestimate revealed that the median months survival in\\ncases with alterations is 73.17 months and cases without\\nalterations is 90.38 months (Additional File 6).\\nTraining-cum-validation\\nWe evaluated training models by 10 fold cross-validation\\nfor the classifiers trained on the four supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms- SMO, Random Forest, J48 and Naïve\\nBayes. All the models were based on standard error base\\nclassifiers. The performances of the generated prediction\\nmodels were compared on the basis of accuracy and\\nauROC values (Table 2). The classification accuracy of the\\ngenerated prediction models ranges from 67.6% for J48, to\\n79.7% for Random Forest; and auROC value ranges from\\n0.7 for J48 to 0.876 for Random Forest. Based on accuracy\\nand auROC, we inferred that Random Forest based predic-\\ntion model has outperformed other three machine learn-\\ning algorithms implemented in the study.\\nIndependent data testing\\nFurthermore, we evaluated our prediction models on an\\nindependent dataset with 55 early stage patients and 40\\nlate stage patients. The performances of the prediction\\nmodels were compared on the basis of standard\\nstatistical measures- accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,\\nF-measure, and auROC (Table 3). We observed coher-\\nence in the performance of the models between inde-\\npendent data testing and 10 fold cross validation based\\non auROC values.\\nWe evaluated sensitivity and specificity plot to deter-\\nmine prediction model with low error rates i.e. high sensi-\\ntivity and specificity. Sensitivity of all the models was in\\nthe range of 79-94%, with highest sensitivity of 93.56% for\\nNaïve Bayes. Specificity of the models varied in a wide\\nrange with lowest of 39.0% for J48 and the highest of\\n60.98% for Random Forest (Figure 2). Although, Naïve\\nBayes based model shows the highest sensitivity, the best\\nsensitivity-specificity trade-off was observed for Random\\nForest Classifier with 88.89% sensitivity and 60.98%\\nspecificity.\\nThe prediction accuracies of all the four predictive mod-\\nels on independent dataset were- 62.11, 72.63, 76.84, 73.68\\nfor J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SMO respec-\\ntively (Table 3). F-measures of the models developed in\\nthe study is between 0.7 to 0.82. It is notable that amongst\\nthe four evaluated prediction models, the model based on\\nRandom Forest displays highest accuracy and F-measure.\\nROC plot is evaluated to characterize threshold inde-\\npendent performance of the prediction models. The ROC\\nplot of the classifiers showing tradeoff between true posi-\\ntive rate and false positive rate in Figure 3 and auROC\\nvalues in Table 3 suggests that prediction models based\\non Random Forest algorithm performed better than\\nNaïve Bayes, SMO and J48.

Previous\\nstudies in ccRCC employs gene expression profiles to pre-\\ndict survival [29,30] and determine newer tumor subtypes\\n[31,32]. We have used gene expression profiles of ccRCC\\nstage specific tumor tissues to train supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms, towards our goal to develop classifica-\\ntion models for early stage to late stage tumor progression\\nof ccRCC.\\nThe TCGA gene expression data for ccRCC patients has\\ndiverse representation of age, gender and tumor stage\\n(Additional File 1). The patients with localized tumors\\n(stage I and II) were class labeled as early stage whereas\\npatients with locally advanced disease (stage III) and meta-\\nstatic disease (stage IV) as late stage. The TCGA gene\\nexpression profile data available for 475 tumor samples\\nand 20,534 genes had no significant batch effects [14] and\\ncame with the “curse of dimensionality”. An efficient fast\\nfilter feature selection method based on predominant\\ncorrelation (fast correlation based feature selection) largely\\nreduced the feature space from 20,534 genes to 62 gene\\nexpression profiles.\\nTo analyze the details of selected training set genes\\nused in development of prediction models for ccRCC,\\nwe first performed GO annotations in which the corre-\\nsponding biological processes displayed very broad but\\nconsistency with cancer hallmarks [33]. Secondly, the\\noncoprint visualization of the selected subset genes\\ndisplayed alterations in all the genomic profiles in 83.6%\\nof the TCGA ccRCC cases. Thirdly, ccRCC cases with\\nalterations in the selected genes had better overall\\nTable 3 Performance of prediction models by standard\\nstatistical evaluation parameters for independent testing\\ndataset.\\nClassifier\\nAccuracy Sensitivity Specificity\\nF-value\\nauROC#\\nJ48\\n62.11\\n79.63%\\n39.02%\\n0.704918\\n0.563\\nNaïve Bayes\\n72.63\\n93.56%\\n48.78%\\n0.790323\\n0.749\\nRandom\\nForest\\n76.84\\n88.89%\\n60.98%\\n0.813559\\n0.778\\nSMO\\n73.68\\n87.04%\\n56.10%\\n0.789916\\n0.716\\n# auROC denotes area under Receivers Operating Characteristic curve.

We\\nhave identified a subset of 62 genes by feature selection,\\nthe expression profiles of which predominantly corre-\\nlates with tumor-stage of the patient given the heteroge-\\nneous data in terms of tumor stage, age group and\\ngender of the patient. We report that Random Forest\\nbased prediction model accurately and reliably classifies\\npatient tumor stages. We anticipate that such prediction\\nmodels based on the molecular correlates could contri-\\nbute to the optimal management of patients in ccRCC.\\nCurrently, the prediction models generated are available\\nupon request to the authors.

This \\nstudy aimed to investigate effects of clinical and sociode-\\nmographic variables on the classification by applying \\nmultivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to both gray mat-\\nter (GM) volume and FC measures in patients with SZ \\nand healthy controls (HC). RS and structural magnetic \\nresonance imaging data (sMRI) from 74 HC and 71 SZ \\npatients were obtained from a Mind Research Network \\nCOBRE dataset available via COINS (http://coins.mrn.\\norg/dx). We used a MVPA framework using support-vec-\\ntor machines embedded in a repeated, nested cross-vali-\\ndation to generate a multi-modal diagnostic system and \\nevaluate its generalizability. The dependence of neurodi-\\nagnostic performance on clinical and sociodemographic \\nvariables was evaluated. The RS classifier showed a \\nslightly higher accuracy (70.5%) compared to the struc-\\ntural classifier (69.7%). The combination of sMRI and \\nRS outperformed single MRI modalities classification \\nby reaching 75% accuracy. The RS based moderator \\nanalysis revealed that the neurodiagnostic performance \\nwas driven by older SZ patients with an earlier illness \\nonset and more pronounced negative symptoms. In con-\\ntrast, there was no linear relationship between the clinical \\nvariables and neuroanatomically derived group member-\\nship measures. This study achieved higher accuracy dis-\\ntinguishing HC from SZ patients by fusing 2 imaging \\nmodalities. In addition the results of RS based modera-\\ntor analysis showed that age of patients, as well as their \\nage at the illness onset were the most important clinical \\nfeatures.\\nKey words: pattern recognition/schizophrenia/ \\nbrain imaging/multimodal/clinical symptoms\\nIntroduction\\nMultivariate pattern recognition methods, such as sup-\\nport vector machines (SVM)1,2 have recently emerged \\nas promising tools for the diagnosis of schizophrenia \\n(SZ) due to their capacity to extract the inter-regional \\ndependencies of distributed brain patterns from high-\\ndimensional training data and generalize the learned \\ndiscriminative rules to unseen patient cohorts.3–5 \\nClassification results from the recent studies suggest \\nthat grey matter (GM) and functional connectivity \\n(FC) alterations provide useful discriminative power to \\nidentify patients with SZ, revealing complex patterns \\nof cortical changes underlying the symptoms of the \\ndisorder.6\\nExtant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings \\nheavily support the “brain surrogate” of SZ that is not \\nconfined to single regions but rather involves distributed \\npattern of brain alterations in both structural4,7 and func-\\ntional MRI (fMRI) modality.8,9 However, although GM \\nchanges in prefrontal, striatal, temporal and parietal \\nregions, as well as FC deficits in a long- and short-range \\nconnections between these brain regions are well repli-\\ncated they are susceptible to the effects of sociodemo-\\ngraphic variables and age in particular.10–12\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS111\\nClassifying Schizophrenia Using Multimodal Multivariate Pattern Recognition Analysis\\nIn the field of neuroanatomical disease classification it \\nhas also been shown that clinical factors such as patients’ \\nage, age of illness onset and symptoms may affect diag-\\nnostic accuracy. A recent meta-analysis6 has shown that \\nalthough illness duration itself did not have a significant \\nimpact on sensitivity and specificity of the unimodal clas-\\nsification, older patients and chronic stage of illness were \\nsignificantly associated with higher sensitivity in RS fMRI \\ndata. These findings might result from more pronounced \\nFC alterations in older subjects with SZ as compared with \\nfirst-episode patients. The more pronounced FC altera-\\ntions have been previously shown in functional studies \\nthat reported a relationship between altered connectivity \\n(topological measurements) and illness duration in SZ.13\\nHowever, the majority of these multivariate pattern \\nanalysis (MVPA) studies used only 1 MRI modality to \\ndetermine the diagnostic membership of study partici-\\npants.14 Some of the recent multimodal imaging studies \\ninvestigating neuronal abnormalities in different MRI \\nmodalities came to a conclusion that multimodal fusion \\nis an effective approach to elucidate disease factors that \\nare shared across different modalities.15–17\\nHowever, more work needs to be done to explore fac-\\ntors determining the diagnostic performance of MRI-\\nbased biomarkers across the life span. Within this context, \\nthe first aim of this study was to thoroughly evaluate the \\nmoderating impact of sociodemographic and clinical vari-\\nables on the model generated by MRI-based classifiers.\\nPrevious studies have shown that integration of different \\nMRI modalities into multi-modal disease models may pro-\\nvide superior classification performance compared to each \\nof these single data channels alone.16,18–21 The potential \\nbenefit of combining different MRI modalities lies in the \\nincrease of the multivariate pattern classification perfor-\\nmance, as well as a broader insight into the neurobiological \\nprocesses underlying SZ. However, defining the optimal \\nway for combining information from different modalities \\nis challenging. Overfitting needs to be avoided and the \\nfusion process has to lead to disease classifiers that remain \\nrobust and operational even if 1 data channel is lost.12\\nWe hypothesized that the sociodemographic and clini-\\ncal moderators heavily determine the applicability of \\nmultimodal predictive models. Furthermore, we explored \\nthe hypothesis that longer duration of illness and higher \\nlevel of psychotic symptoms are paralleled by more pro-\\nnounced GM and FC abnormalities in patients.\\nMethods\\nParticipants\\nThe study included 74 HC and 71 SZ patients. Imaging \\nand phenotypic information was drawn from a Mind \\nResearch Network Center of Biomedical Research \\nExcellence (COBRE), funded by the National Institutes \\nof Health. This data is publicly available via the COINS \\ndata exchange (http://coins.mrn.org/dx).22 Detailed study \\nprocedures are described at http://cobre.mrn.org/. In \\nsummary, patients received the diagnosis of SZ by clini-\\ncal psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview \\nfor DSM-IV.\\nPsychopathological symptoms were rated using the \\nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).23 The \\nantipsychotic medication at MRI scan was converted to \\nchlorpromazine and olanzapine equivalents (table 1).\\nAll subjects were screened and excluded if they had any \\nhistory of neurological disorder, history of mental retar-\\ndation, history of severe head trauma with more than 5 \\nminutes loss of consciousness, history of substance abuse \\nor dependence within the last 12 months. Informed con-\\nsent was obtained from all subjects according to insti-\\ntutional guidelines required by the Institutional Review \\nBoard at the University New Mexico (UNM).\\nData Acquisition and Preprocessing\\nAll participants were scanned on a 3 Tesla SIEMENS \\nTIM scanner with a 12-channel radio-frequency coil at \\nthe Mind Research Network. All the prepocessing steps \\nwere performed in the NeuroDiagnostic Applications \\ngroup of the Psychiatric Hospital of the LMU.\\nStructural Image Acquisition and Preprocessing\\nStructural images were obtained using a multi-echo \\nMPRAGE sequence with the following parameters: time \\nof repetition (TR) = 2530, echo time (TE) = (1.64, 3.5, \\n5.36, 7.22, 9.08), inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, flip angle \\n= 7°, field of view (FOV) 256 × 256 mm, slice thickness \\n= 176 mm, matrix size 256 × 256 × 176, voxel size 1 mm × \\n1 mm × 1 mm, Pixel band width 650 Hz. Structural MRI \\ndata were preprocessed using the VBM 8 toolbox (http://\\ndbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm8/), which was used to seg-\\nment the brain into white matter (WM), GM, and cerebral \\nspinal fluid (CSF). The VBM8 toolbox extends the uni-\\nfied segmentation model of SPM824 by the (1) application \\nof the Optimized Blockwise Nonlocal-Means Filter to \\nincrease the signal-to-noise ratio of the data,25 (2) segmen-\\ntation into GM, WM, and CSF using an adaptive maxi-\\nmum a posteriori approach26 extended by a partial volume \\nestimation model,27,28 and (3) post-processing using a hid-\\nden Markov Random Field model.29 This preprocessing \\nproduced modulated and GM segments were then nor-\\nmalized to MNI structural template using the DARTEL \\nalgorithm30 and re-sampled to 3 mm, isotropic resolution.\\nFunctional Image Acquisition and Preprocessing\\nBlood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) images of the \\nwhole brain using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence \\nwere acquired in 32 axial slices (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 29 ms, \\nflip angle =75°, FOV  =  24 cm, 3.5 mm thickness and \\n1.05 mm gap, matrix size= 64 × 64, voxel size 3.75 mm \\n× 3.75 mm × 4.55 mm) using the intercommissural line \\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS112\\nC. Cabral et al\\n(AC-PC) as a reference. RS scans resulted in 304 seconds \\nduration (152 volumes) and subjects were instructed to \\nkeep their eyes open during the scan and stare passively \\nat a foveally presented fixation cross, as this is suggested \\nto facilitate network delineation compared to eyes-closed \\nconditions and helps to ensure that subjects are awake.\\nFunctional RS data were processed as follows: First, \\nafter discarding the first 10 images (magnetization equi-\\nlibrium not reached) and 2 dummy scans, the remain-\\ning 140 images were unwarped and realigned to the \\nfirst volume for head-motion correction. Secondly, the \\ntime course of head motions was obtained by estimat-\\ning the translations in each direction and the rotations \\nin angular motion about each axis for each volume \\nusing SPM8, (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The \\nunwarped and realigned images underwent background \\nfiltering and exclusive masking of the cerebellum to \\naccount for the low signal to noise ratio in this brain \\nregion. Subsequently, temporal band-pass filtering \\n(0.01–0.08 Hz) was performed to reduce the effects of \\nlow-frequency drift and high-frequency noise using the \\nREST toolbox31 (http://restfmri.net/forum/REST). We \\nregressed out the global brain signal, mean white matter \\nsignal (0.9 threshold), mean CSF signal (0.7 threshold) \\nand the 6 motion parameters.\\nThen, the Montreal Neurological Institute struc-\\ntural template was high-dimensionally registered to each \\nsubject’s structural scan using the DRAMMS algorithm32 \\n(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dramms/), which encoded \\nlinear and nonlinear deformations in the template space \\nrelative to each individual’s subject space. Following a rigid \\nbody transformation (6 degrees of freedom) from the sub-\\nject’s structural image to the mean functional image, the 2 \\ntransformations were respectively applied to the template-\\nspace AAL atlas33 thus parcellating each subject’s series of \\nfunctional images using the warped AAL atlas. Then, the \\nmean time series in each of the 90 AAL regions was com-\\nputed by averaging voxel-level time series.

The remaining 13 subjects \\nwere used as independent validation set, meaning that \\nthese subjects were kept out of the model estimation pro-\\ncess and used as previously unseen data (table 1).\\nTo strictly separate the training process from the \\nevaluation of the predictor’s generalization capacity, \\nthe pipeline was completely embedded into a repeated \\ndouble cross-validation framework (rdCV).35 As previ-\\nously described, rdCV computes an unbiased estimate \\nof the method’s expected diagnostic accuracy on new \\ncases, rather than merely fitting the current study popu-\\nlation. Furthermore, rdCV produces classifier ensembles \\nthat separate single individuals from different groups, \\nwhile avoiding overfitting to the peculiarities of the \\ntraining data.\\nMore specifically, the following analysis steps were \\nwrapped into a 20-fold cross-validation cycle at the \\nouter (CV2) and a 20-fold cross-validation at the inner \\n(CV1) cycles of rdCV. Both MIM and GM maps were \\nscaled feature wise and for the GM maps, due to its \\ninherent high dimensionality, principal component \\nanalysis (PCA)36 was used to reduce feature dimen-\\nsionality. The principal components with the highest \\neigenvalues that cumulatively explained 80% of the \\nvariance were selected and the single subject GM maps \\nwere projected into the reduced principal components \\nspace. The resulting PC features (GM maps) and the \\nscaled MIM (FC) were, independently, fed to a linear \\nL2-regularized Logistic Regression (L2-LR) imple-\\nmented in the LIBLINEAR toolbox (http://www.csie.\\nntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/). The slack variable, C, was \\nestimated in the inner cycle of the cross validation, for \\nboth modalities independently.\\nFinally, unseen CV1 and CV2 test subjects, as well as \\nindividuals in the independent validation set were pro-\\ncessed by successively applying all training parameters \\nto the test data. The classifier determined a test sub-\\nject’s geometric position relative to the learned deci-\\nsion boundary, resulting in a group membership score \\nand predicted membership (determined by sign of the \\ngroup membership score). This analysis sequence was \\nrepeated for each CV1 training partition in a given \\nCV2 training fold, thus generating an ensemble classi-\\nfier which computed a CV2 test subject’s group mem-\\nbership by averaging the decision scores of its L2-LR \\nbase learners. Finally, for each subject, ensemble \\ngroup membership scores were averaged across those \\ntraining partitions, in which the subject had not been \\ninvolved in the training and optimization process, and \\nthus determining its final out-of-training (OOT) group \\nmembership score.\\nThe previously described classification procedure \\nwas applied independently to both GM maps and MIM \\nresulting, for each subject, in 2 OOT decision score, \\none based on the structural and one the fMRI data. \\nThe fusion of the data domains was then performed by \\ntaking the mean of the 2 OOT decision scores for each \\nsubject, resulting in a multi-modal class  membership \\nscore from which the multimodal class membership was \\nderived.\\nThe models described above were then applied to inde-\\npendent test data to further validate the method.\\nFor the clinical moderator analyses, a ν support \\nvector regression (ν-SVR) was applied to predict the \\nsingle modality OOT group membership scores based \\non clinical variables (table 1; for more details supple-\\nmentary materials table  3). The clinical analysis was \\nperformed on 62 SZ subjects with complete data sets. \\nSimilarly to the classification process an rdCV frame-\\nwork was employed to derive an unbiased estimation \\nof the method’s performance. For each CV2 fold the \\nfeatures were scaled, feature wise and a filter method, \\nthe Pearson correlation between the feature and the \\nlabel, was applied to filter uninformative features.37 The \\nselected scaled clinical features were used to predict \\nthe group membership scores with a ν-SVR as imple-\\nmented in LIBSVM with ν and C estimated in the inner \\ncycle of the CV framework.\\nResults\\nBoth functional and structural classifiers were able to dis-\\ntinguish between HC and SZ patients with similar accura-\\ncies. The GM classifier showed a slightly lower accuracy \\nof 69.7 % (P &lt; .001; specificity 63.4% / sensitivity 82.4%) \\ncomparing to 70.5% accuracy of the RS classifier (speci-\\nficity 69.7% / sensitivity 71.2%).\\nThe accuracy for the OOCV dataset in the RS fMRI \\nwas 76.9 % (P = .09; specificity 62.5 % / specificity 100 %) \\nand 92.3 % (P = .003; specificity 87.5 % / sensitivity 100 \\n%) for the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI).\\nEnsemble-based data fusion outperformed pattern \\nclassification based on single MRI modalities by reach-\\ning 75 % accuracy classifier (P &lt; .001; specificity 71.2% / \\nsensitivity 78.8%).\\nFor the OOCV data the fusion improved the classifica-\\ntion accuracy achieving for this dataset 100% accuracy \\n(P &lt; .001).\\nStructural Analysis\\nThe structural pattern identified by the classifier (figure 1) \\nconsisted of (1) GM volume reductions in bilateral frontal, \\ntemporal, angular, supramarginal, insular, anterior cingu-\\nlate, parahippocampal, and postcentral cortices and bilateral \\nsubcortical structures (striatum and thalamus), and (2) GM \\nvolume increments in the cerebellum, as well as parietal and \\noccipital brain regions (supplementary materials table 1).\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS114\\nC.

Notably, frequently \\nselected demographic and clinical features were: current \\nage, age of the first psychotic symptoms, age at first psy-\\nchiatric illness, age at first psychiatric hospitalization, \\ndifficulty in abstract thinking, emotional withdrawal and \\nPANSS negative summary score.\\nDiscussion\\nThis study aimed to investigate potential effects of clini-\\ncal and sociodemographic variables on the performance \\nof neurodiagnostic classification. We initially confirmed \\nthat combination of GM and RS predictions outper-\\nformed pattern classification based on single MRI modal-\\nities by reaching 75% accuracy for this analysis compared \\nto ~70% accuracy for the single modalities. The appli-\\ncation of the proposed method to the independent test \\ndata resulted in accuracies near 100% this might be a \\nconsequence of the small size and demographic profile of \\nthis subsample, notably the age differences between the \\ngroups, young HC versus old SZ (table 1). Furthermore, \\nthe filter method employed as feature selection approach \\nin the regression helped us to identify the subset of the \\nclinical and demographic features that were most predic-\\ntive for the RS decision scores. The particular features \\nas patients’ current age and age of illness onset had the \\nhighest probability to be selected. Specifically, older \\nSZ patients with a later onset of illness and more pro-\\nnounced negative symptoms were more reliably assigned \\nto the SZ group by the RS classifier. Our findings about \\nmore pronounced changes in FC in older subjects with \\nSZ could be a result of accelerated „brain aging” in SZ,12 \\nas previous studies on normal aging already pointed out \\nat reduced FC in healthy elderly.38 Additionally, the age \\nof onset is an important predictor of SZ group member-\\nship as patients with a “later” age of illness onset, after \\nadolescence, seem to be characterized by greater FC defi-\\ncits. Previous MRI studies on biomarkers have shown \\nthat brain-specific deviations are dynamically related \\nto age and illness duration trajectories.13,39,40 For exam-\\nple, several studies showed that structural classifiers are \\nvery sensitive to age-related effects across the lifespan,12 \\nreporting accelerated „brain aging” in SZ putatively due \\nto dysmaturational processes in the early course of the \\nillness. The latest publications in the field are indicating \\nthat the acceleration is especially large in the first years \\nafter the disease onset.41 Though we were able to replicate \\nfindings from diverse studies that suggest GM changes in \\nSZ in a pattern involving both cortical and subcortical \\nstructures the structural classifier based on GM altera-\\ntions operated independently of sociodemographic and \\nclinical measures in our study. The reason could lie in \\nthe heterogeneous cohort that consist of many chronic \\nSZ Patients with different onset and duration of illness in \\nwhich the difference between chronological and the neu-\\nroanatomical age (brain age gap estimation [BrainAGE]) \\nmight be exhibiting ceiling effect.\\nIn the RS data domain it seems that the “later” illness \\nonset, after adolescence, may be responsible for the more \\nseverely disrupted FC in patients with SZ. This may not \\nbe reflecting the innate relationship between the FC and \\nage trajectories, but could be due to the fact that the later \\nonsets of illness are associated with older patients in our \\nsample.\\nMajority or aberrant connections in the SZ group were \\nsubcortical short range connections with a particular \\nemphasis on interhemispheric connections. This is not \\nsurprising considering that previous studies on inter-\\nhemispheric connectivity in SZ have shown evidence for \\nweakening of FC between the 2 brain hemispheres involv-\\ning a number of cortical and limbic regions.42 Aberrant \\nlong range connections of the SZ group in fronto-occipi-\\ntal, fronto-parietal,43 fronto-temporal9,44 and cortico-tha-\\nlamic regions45 were also embedded in the most predictive \\nset of functional features.\\n Importantly, the aberrant fronto-temporal connectiv-\\nity could explain the impaired recruitment of cognitive \\nverbal processing46 which contributes to negative symp-\\ntoms in the speech domain.47–49 Aberrant cortico-striatal \\nconnections have also been previously shown to be related \\nto negative symptoms of the SZ group.50\\nThe limitation of the study is that the chronic effects \\nof antipsychotics could contribute to the altered FC with \\nlonger duration of illness. Unfortunately, although the \\nsample contains information on the medication, we had \\nno information on “life time” medication. Importantly, \\nsuch chronic exposure to antipsychotic medication may \\nalso alter FC.51\\nOur results from the recent meta-analysis underline \\nthe utility of multivariate pattern recognition approaches \\ndespite the clinical heterogeneity of the SZ phenotype. \\nWe demonstrated that combination of sMRI and RS \\nfMRI provides even higher accuracy in discriminating \\nSZ patients from HC by optimizing deficiencies of single \\nmodality prediction. Furthermore, our finding on aber-\\nrant connectivity in SZ that starts in early adulthood \\nsupports the hypothesis that such psychopathological \\nabnormalities are paralleled by more pronounced brain \\nabnormalities which could be more easily detectable with \\nRS classifiers compared to structural classifiers.\\nFuture studies need to proceed further to identify clini-\\ncal variables that are relevant for the real-world applica-\\ntion, as well as for the clinical reliability of multivariate \\nmethods and novel therapeutical approaches.\\nSupplementary Material\\nSupplementary material is available at http://schizophre-\\nniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org.\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS116\\nC.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in US after cardiovascular disease. Image-based com-\\nputer-aided diagnosis can assist physicians to efficiently diagnose cancers in early stages. Existing computer-\\naided algorithms use hand-crafted features such as wavelet coefficients, co-occurrence matrix features, and\\nrecently, histogram of shearlet coefficients for classification of cancerous tissues and cells in images. These\\nhand-crafted features often lack generalizability since every cancerous tissue and cell has a specific texture,\\nstructure, and shape. An alternative approach is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the most\\nappropriate feature abstractions directly from the data and handle the limitations of hand-crafted features.\\nA framework for breast cancer detection and prostate Gleason grading using CNN trained on images along\\nwith the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients is presented. Particularly, we apply shearlet transform\\non images and extract the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients. Then we feed shearlet features\\nalong with the original images to our CNN consisting of multiple layers of convolution, max pooling, and\\nfully connected layers. Our experiments show that using the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients as\\nextra information to the network can improve the accuracy of detection and generalize better compared to\\nthe state-of-the-art methods that rely on hand-crafted features. This study expands the application of deep\\nneural networks into the field of medical image analysis, which is a difficult domain considering the limited\\nmedical data available for such analysis. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10.1117/1.JMI.3\\n.4.044501]\\nKeywords: microscopic images; prostate cancer; breast cancer; deep neural network; shearlet transform.\\nPaper 16119R received Jun. 21, 2016; accepted for publication Oct. 11, 2016; published online Nov. 3, 2016.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nIt is estimated that about 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will\\noccur in US during 2016.1 Prostate and breast cancers are the\\nsecond most dominant causes of death among cancers in\\nmales and females, respectively.1 Cancer cells can transfer to\\nother tissues and develop new tumors. Hence, it is vital to diag-\\nnose and grade cancer in early stages and provide necessary\\ntreatment. Histological analysis of tissue slides stained using\\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) is the main approach for cancer\\ndetection and grading. This process involves a pathologist\\nexamining large areas of benign tissue to finally detect the\\nareas of malignancy. Therefore, cancer detection is very time-\\nconsuming and challenging. The Gleason grading system is\\nthe main approach for prostate grading,2 which classifies the\\nprostate cancer as grades 1 to 5 with increasing malignancy\\nas the grade increases. The Gleason score is calculated using\\nthe sum of the two most dominant Gleason grades inside a tissue\\nand ranges from 2 to 10. Patients with a combined score between\\n2 and 4 mostly survive while patients with a score of 8 to 10\\nhave a higher mortality rate.2 Automating the cancer diagnosis\\nand the grading process can reduce the time needed by pathol-\\nogists and remove the inter- and intraobserver variations.3\\nAutomated medical image classification is an important\\nresearch area which utilizes different feature detection and rep-\\nresentation techniques. These features can be classified into\\ntwo main categories: hand-crafted and learned features. Hand-\\ncrafted features are based on the pathologists’ approaches for\\ncancer diagnosis and grading. Pathologists scan tissue slides\\nand try to find symptoms of tumor progress including irregularly\\nshaped nuclei and lack of differentiation. Therefore, most of\\nautomated histological analysis methods first segment the cell\\nnuclei, then extract features from cell nuclei and use them\\nfor classification.4–6 For example, Boucheron et al.4 performed\\nimage segmentation on histopathology images of breast and\\nused the extracted features for breast cancer detection. Farjam\\net al.5 segmented the prostate glands and extracted structural fea-\\ntures from them and used them in a tree-structured algorithm for\\nautomatic Gleason grading of prostate. Stotzka et al.6 used fea-\\ntures extracted from cell nuclei along with neural networks for\\nautomatic grading of the prostate. Some other techniques that\\nused hand-crafted features are based on texture, color, and mor-\\nphological features.7–12 Jafari-Khouzani and Soltanian-Zadeh7\\nextracted energy and entropy from multiwavelets coefficients\\nand used them for the task of automatic Gleason grading of pros-\\ntate. They used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to classify\\nimages. Tabesh et al.8 extracted color, texture, and morphomet-\\nric features from microscopic images of prostate and combined\\nthem and used them for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason\\ngrading. In an earlier study,9 we extracted features from multi-\\ndecomposition levels of shearlet filters and used the histogram\\nof shearlet coefficients (HSCs) for the task of classification of\\nbenign and malignant breast slides using support vector machine\\n*Address\\nall\\ncorrespondence\\nto:\\nHadi\\nRezaeilouyeh,\\nE-mail:\\nhadi.\\nrezaeilouyeh@du.edu\\n2329-4302/2016/$25.00 © 2016 SPIE\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-1\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nJournal of Medical Imaging 3(4), 044501 (Oct–Dec 2016)\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\n(SVM) and achieved 75% classification accuracy. We also used\\nHSC for prostate cancer detection of histological images10 and\\nmagnetic resonance (MR) images11 and achieved 100% and\\n97% classification accuracy, respectively. In a recent study,12\\nwe extracted multiple features from the histological images of\\nprostate cancer and used the multiple kernel learning (MKL)\\nalgorithm for fusing the features. Then we used SVM equipped\\nwith MKL for the classification of prostate slides with different\\nGleason grades.\\nMost of the methods mentioned above merge different hand-\\ncrafted features to represent the texture of histopathology\\nimages. These methods usually include some preprocessing\\n(e.g., segmentation) and the final classification result depends\\non the accuracy of the previous steps. In addition, these hand-\\ncrafted features are designed for a specific type of problem.\\nIt is time-consuming to design a new set of features and they\\nare not easily applicable on different datasets. Furthermore,\\nsome of these hand-crafted features have inherent limitations\\nthat make them less efficient for complex tasks. A good example\\nwould be the wavelet transform, which has been widely used for\\ndifferent applications including cancer diagnosis and grading.5–8\\nWavelets do not have directional sensitivity, which makes them\\nunsuitable for detecting directional features. That was the\\nmotive for using shearlets instead of wavelets in our previous\\nstudies9–12 and in this paper as well. On the other hand, recent\\nfeature learning methods have gained a lot of attention due to the\\nsuccess of deep neural networks methods in computer vision\\napplications. The advances in computational power and the\\navailability of large training databases also played an important\\nrole in the development of deep neural networks.13 Deep learn-\\ning (DL) is a subset of machine learning models that represents\\nhigh-level abstractions extracted directly from images using\\nnonlinear transformations.13,14 The main advantage of DL meth-\\nods is their ability to form hierarchical representations of data by\\nderiving higher level features from lower level features using\\nnonlinear processing units.13 Therefore, despite hand-crafted\\nfeatures, learned features do not need any preprocessing and\\ncan easily be transferred to different applications since they are\\ndata-driven.15 These methods often outperform traditional\\napproaches that use hand-crafted features.16–19 Cruz-Roa et al.15\\nproposed a three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN)\\nmethod for invasive ductal carcinoma detection in histopathol-\\nogy images of breast cancer and compared their method with\\nhand-crafted features. They reported 6% improvement in the\\nclassification accuracy when using their CNN. Liao et al.16 pro-\\nposed a stacked-independent subspace analysis DL framework\\nfor prostate T2 MR image segmentation. They reported 3%\\nimprovement in segmentation accuracy when using their DL\\nframework. Couture et al.17 proposed a sparse coding-based\\nhierarchical feature learning method for breast cancer detection\\nin histopathology images. They were able to increase the clas-\\nsification accuracy by 6% using their proposed feature learning\\nmethod. Cireşan et al.18 presented a DL method based on max\\npooling for mitosis detection in histology images of breast\\ncancer. They won the International Conference on Pattern\\nRecognition 2012 competition. Li et al.19 used shearlet trans-\\nform and deep neural networks for image quality assessment.\\nThey extracted features using the sum of subband shearlet coef-\\nficients and used stacked autoencoders as their main neural net-\\nwork building blocks. They used a softmax classifier to assess\\nthe quality of images in their dataset. In this paper, we propose a\\nshearlet-based deep neural network method for breast cancer\\ndetection and Gleason grading of prostate. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first time that shearlet transform and\\nDL are employed together for medical image classification.\\nOur main contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we\\npropose using the phase of shearlet coefficients as a primary fea-\\nture for general purpose microscopic medical image classifica-\\ntion. This is the first study that utilizes the phase of shearlets for\\nsuch applications. Shearlet transform20 is a directional multi-\\nscale representation system with affine properties which can\\ndetect anisotropic features at different orientations and scales.\\nMost of the signal’s information is carried by the phase21 and\\nthe phase features are invariant to noise and image contrast.22\\nHowever, since the phase information is nontrivial, it is difficult\\nto design and hand-craft phase features that work as a general\\napproach. This motivated us to further improve our proposed\\nmethod as follows. Second, we add the magnitude of shearlet\\ncoefficients and the RGB images to the phase features. The mag-\\nnitude of shearlet coefficients is a direct representative of the\\nsingularities in the image and the higher the magnitude, the\\nhigher the possibility of an edge occurring in that location.23\\nThe reason to include the RGB images is in the nature of\\nthis problem. Since these images are H&amp;E stained, the color\\ninformation is very important for breast cancer detection and\\nGleason grading. As cancer happens and the grade increases,\\nthe cell nuclei (stained blue) become larger and the cytoplasm\\narea (stained pink) shrinks. Therefore, we need to consider color\\ninformation as one of our primary features as well. Third, we\\npropose a deep neural network as an evolution process to\\nexplore the aforementioned features (phase and magnitude of\\nshearlet coefficients and RGB images) and use them for cancer\\ndetection and Gleason grading. Our CNN consists of multiple\\nlayers of convolutions followed by max pooling along with fully\\nconnected and dropout layers. In summary, our contributions are\\nlisted below:\\n• Utilize phase of shearlet coefficients as a primary feature\\nfor microscopic medical image classification.\\n• Empower magnitude of shearlet coefficients and RGB\\nimages to support the phase features.\\n• Employ deep neural networks to explore the shearlet-\\nbased image representations and RGB images and learn\\nfeatures for image classification.\\nThe proposed framework for microscopic medical image\\nclassification is presented in Fig. 1. The remainder of this\\npaper is organized as follows. The proposed framework consist-\\ning of shearlet transform and CNN is presented in Sec. 2. In\\nSec. 3, the experimental setup and results along with the analysis\\nof the proposed framework are presented in detail. Finally in\\nSec. 4, discussions and conclusions are presented.\\n2\\nMethodology\\nProstate Gleason grading and breast cancer detection are mainly\\nbased on texture features and characteristics of cancerous tissues\\nas shown in Fig. 2. It is noticeable that as the Gleason grade\\nincreases [Fig. 2(b)], the texture becomes more detailed and\\nthe epithelial cell nuclei grow in a random manner and spread\\nacross the tissue. Therefore, we need an accurate and robust tex-\\nture analysis technique. For this purpose, we propose to extract\\nour primary features from microscopic images using magnitude\\nand phase of shearlet coefficients and evolve these features\\nusing DL techniques to make them more discriminative.

Despite its predecessors, e.g.,\\ncurvelet25 where the direction is defined using rotation, shearlet\\ndefines the direction using shearing matrices, which makes\\nthe discrete implementation of shearlets easier and also makes\\nthe shearlet rotation-invariant.\\nThe continuous shearlet transform20 is defined as the map-\\nping for fϵR2\\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e001;63;131SHΨfða; s; tÞ ≤ f; Ψa;s;t &gt;;\\na &gt; 0; sεR; tεR2;\\n(1)\\nwhere the shearlets are defined as the following:\\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e002;63;88Ψa;s;tðxÞ ¼ j det Ma;sj−1\\n2ΨðM−1\\na;sx − tÞ;\\n(2)\\nwhere Ma;s ¼\\n� a\\nﬃﬃﬃa\\np s\\n0\\nﬃﬃﬃa\\np\\n�\\n¼ BsAa, where Aa ¼\\n� a\\n0\\n0\\nﬃﬃﬃa\\np\\n�\\n,\\nand Bs ¼\\n� 1\\ns\\n0\\n1\\n�\\n. Ma;s is the multiplication of an anisotropic\\ndilation matrix (Aa) and a shearing matrix ( Bs), which makes\\nthe shearlets well localized. By incorporating the translation,\\nscale, and shear parameters, shearlet is able to detect directional\\nsingularities and geometrical features of multidimensional data.\\nA recent implementation of shearlets called “fast finite\\nshearlet transform” (FFST)24 uses fast Fourier transform for\\ndiscrete implementation of shearlets in the frequency domain\\nand consequently produces complex shearlet coefficients. Since\\nwe wanted to extract the phase of shearlet coefficients, we\\nutilized this implementation of shearlets in this paper. The\\nphase along with the magnitude of shearlet coefficients is then\\nfed to a deep neural network for automatic Gleason grading and\\nbreast cancers diagnosis.\\nShearlet has some interesting mathematical properties.26,27\\nShearlets are well localized; they are compactly supported in\\nthe frequency domain. They have parabolic scaling and each\\nelement of shearlets is supported on a pair of trapezoids. They\\nhave high directional sensitivity. Shearlets are spatially localized\\nFig. 2 Prostate tissue samples with different Gleason grade: (a) grade 2 and (b) grade 5.\\nFig. 1 Block diagram of our proposed framework consisting of the training and test phases.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-3\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nand optimally sparse. To summarize, shearlets form a tight frame\\nof well-localized waveforms at different scales and directions\\nand are optimally sparse for representing edges in the images.\\nThese properties make the shearlet a well-suited tool for\\ndetecting singularities in different cancerous tissues in micro-\\nscopic images.\\n2.2\\nFeatures Extracted from Shearlet Transform\\nThe success of a classification framework highly depends on\\nthe choice of the feature representation method. In this paper,\\nwe are interested in microscopic image classification, especially\\nin prostate Gleason grading and breast cancer diagnosis. Taking\\nanother look at Fig. 2 highlights the changes that a tissue cell\\ngoes through when the Gleason grade increases. As the Gleason\\ngrade increases, epithelial cells randomly duplicate, disturbing\\nthe normal structure of glands.4 The higher grade cells are\\ndescribed by irregular morphology in nuclei, larger nuclei, and\\nless cytoplasm than lower grades as shown in Fig. 2. A similar\\nprocess happens to breast tissue when cancer develops. To re-\\npresent these textural and morphological properties of the can-\\ncerous tissues, we apply the shearlet transform on microscopic\\nimages and extract magnitude and phase of complex shearlet\\ncoefficients and use them as our primary features. To better illus-\\ntrate the effectiveness of the shearlet transform for microscopic\\nimage classification, we show benign and malignant breast tis-\\nsue images along with their corresponding magnitude and phase\\nof shearlet coefficients from a single subband in Fig. 3. One can\\nFig. 3 Sample images of breast tissue and their corresponding magnitude and phase of shearlet coef-\\nficients from a single subband: (a) original benign, (b) original malignant, (c) magnitude of shearlets for\\nbenign, (d) magnitude of shearlets for malignant, (e) phase of shearlets for benign, and (f) phase of shear-\\nlets for malignant.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-4\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nobserve how the statistics of shearlet coefficients change as the\\ntissue transforms from benign to malignant. This effect is more\\nobvious in the magnitude of shearlet coefficients compared to\\nthe phase of shearlet coefficients. This is because the magnitude\\nof shearlet coefficients is a direct representative of the singular-\\nities in the image and the higher the magnitude, the higher the\\npossibility of an edge occurring in that location.23 One way to\\nrepresent statistical properties of shearlet coefficients is to\\nextract histograms from the magnitude of shearlet coefficients.\\nWe previously used HSCs for breast cancer detection9 and pros-\\ntate cancer detection11 and Gleason grading.10,12 Figure 4 shows\\nthe histogram of magnitude of shearlet coefficients for two\\ncases. Figure 4(a) shows the HSCs for a pair of benign and\\nmalignant images, where they were correctly classified. The\\nshape and peaks of histograms are different for benign and\\nmalignant images. Figure 4(b) shows a failed case where the\\nimages were incorrectly classified using the HSC method.\\nThe shape and the peaks of the histograms are very similar. One\\npossible reason is that the histogram does not include any infor-\\nmation on the local structure of the images.\\nThe importance of phase in image processing and computer\\nvision has been investigated in previous studies.28–22 It was veri-\\nfied that most of the signal’s information is carried by the\\nphase21 and in some cases only the phase is enough to recon-\\nstruct a signal.28 Also, the phase features are invariant to noise\\nand image contrast.22 However, since the phase information is\\nnontrivial, it is difficult to design and hand-craft phase features\\nthat work as a general approach. For example, the histogram of\\nphase features does not sufficiently represent the changes in the\\ntexture of an image since, despite magnitude, the phase does not\\ndirectly relate to strong edges. This motivated us to add the\\nphase information to the magnitude and learn features instead\\nof hand-crafting them in this paper. We extract the magnitude\\nand phase of shearlet coefficients as follows.\\nAssume we denote a complex shearlet coefficient by\\ncða; s; tÞ ¼ x þ iy, where x and y are the real and imaginary\\nparts of a complex shearlet coefficient and a, s, and t are the scale,\\nshear, and translation parameters of the shearlet transform, respec-\\ntively. We use the following equations to extract the magnitude\\n[magða; s; tÞ] and the phase [phaseða; s; tÞ] of the coefficients\\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e003;63;119\\nmagða; s; tÞ ¼ jcða; s; tÞj ¼\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nx2 þ y2\\nq\\nphaseða; s; tÞ ¼ ∡½cða; s; tÞ� ¼ tan−1�y\\nx\\n�\\n:\\n(3)\\nAfter we extracted the above features from each subband of\\nthe shearlets, then we feed them to our deep neural network as\\nexplained in Sec. 2.3.\\n2.3\\nConvolutional Neural Networks and Feature\\nLearning\\nOur primary features are magnitude and phase of shearlet coef-\\nficients along with RGB data. As we previously explained,\\nhand-crafting the features is not a suitable method for complex\\ntasks (e.g., medical image analysis, where important clinical fea-\\ntures are used to represent objects such as cell nuclei). There-\\nfore, in the following, we propose our automatic feature learning\\nmethod based on deep neural networks.\\nTraditional machine learning methods have limited abilities\\nto analyze natural data that are represented in their raw form.\\nThis is due to the fact that shallow classifiers need appropriate\\nfeature extraction and representation techniques, which are sen-\\nsitive to the discriminative attributes of the input while invariant\\nto unimportant features (selectivity–invariance dilemma).29 On\\nthe other hand, DL methods29–32 consist of multiple processing\\nlayers to learn representations directly from raw data with multi-\\nple levels of abstraction.29 For an image, the lower levels of\\nabstraction might correspond to the edges in the image, while\\nhigher abstraction layers correspond to the objects in the image.\\nCNNs30 are feed-forward networks consisting of consecutive\\npairs of convolutional and pooling layers along with fully\\nconnected layers. They are especially designed for inputs rep-\\nresented as 2-D data (e.g., images). The input data first go\\nthrough pairs of convolution and pooling layers. Convolution\\nlayers apply 2-D convolution on their inputs using rectangular\\nfilters, which are applied in different positions of the input. The\\nconvolution layer sums the responses from previous layer, adds\\na bias term, and drives the result through a nonlinear activation\\nfunction. This process is repeated with different weights to cre-\\nate multiple feature maps. The output of the convolutional layer\\nthen usually passes through a pooling layer, which is a down-\\nsampling technique and results in translation-invariant features.\\nAfter a few pairs of convolution and pooling layers, one or more\\nfully connected layers combine the outputs into a feature vector.\\nThe final layer is a fully connected layer with one neuron per\\nclass (two for breast cancer diagnosis and four for Gleason grad-\\ning), which are activated by a softmax classifier. Throughout the\\nwhole process, the weights are optimized by minimizing the\\nmisclassification error using stochastic gradient descent method.\\nFig. 4 HSCs for (a) correctly classified benign and malignant pair, and (b) incorrectly classified pair.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-5\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nThe building blocks of our proposed deep neural network are\\npresented in Fig. 5.

Convolutional layer (conv): This layer applies a 2-D con-\\nvolution on the input feature maps using 64 Gaussian\\nfilters of size 5 × 5 initialized with a standard deviation\\nof 0.0001 and bias of zero. It steps 2 pixels between\\neach filter application. The output then goes through a\\nnonlinear rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, which\\nis defined as fðzÞ ¼ maxðz; 0Þ.

The inputs are RGB images, magnitude of shearlet\\ncoefficients from decomposition levels 1 to 5 (Mag1 to Mag5), and phase of shearlet coefficients from\\ndecomposition levels 1 to 5 (Phase1 to Phase5). Then they go through separate CNNs and the results\\nare concatenated using a fully connected layer, which sends the final evolved features to softmax for\\nclassification.\\nFig. 6 Architecture of our CNN.

Then three layers of convolution and pooling are applied on the input back\\nto back to extract abstracts from the input. Finally, a fully connected layer combines the outputs of\\nconvolution filters and sends out a single feature vector with the size of 64.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-6\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nif a linear function was used, the entire network would\\nbe equivalent to a single-layer neural network.\\n2. Max-pooling layer: The purpose of the pooling layer is\\nto combine similar features into one; therefore, it is\\na feature dimension reduction technique. It calculates\\nthe maximum of a local patch of units inside a 3 × 3\\nregion of input feature map and steps 2 pixels between\\npooling regions. This makes the learned features\\ninvariant to shifts and distortions.\\n3.

Fully connected layer: Also known as inner product\\nthis is one of the top layers of a CNN architecture. It\\nconnects all the neurons in the previous layer to all the\\nneurons it has. It does not have any spatial informa-\\ntion. It takes the output of pooling layers as input\\nand combines them into a feature vector, similar to\\na multilayer perceptron network.\\n5. Dropout: Dropout regularization33 randomly disables\\nportion of neurons in the training set. This prevents\\nthe overfitting of learning results to the structure of the\\nnetwork. In this paper, we chose the dropout threshold\\nto be 0.7.\\n6. Classification layer: The final layer of CNN is a fully\\nconnected layer with one neuron per class (two for\\nbreast cancer diagnosis and four for Gleason grading),\\nwhich is activated by the softmax classifier. Given the\\ntraining labels, it gives the accuracy of the classification.\\n3\\nExperiments and Results\\nIn this section, first we describe our data preprocessing in detail.\\nThen we explain our feature extraction using shearlets transform\\nand CNN structure and parameters. Finally, we present our\\nresults and compare them with the state-of-the-art methods\\nbased on hand-crafted features.\\n3.1\\nDatasets and Data Preparation\\nWe used two microscopic medical imaging datasets for our\\nexperiments. The first set was the University of California,\\nSanta Barbara Biosegmentation Benchmark dataset.34 This data-\\nset contained 58 H&amp;E-stained histopathology images of breast\\ntissue. Out of 58 total images, there were 26 malignant images\\nand 32 benign images. The second dataset was the prostate\\nGleason grading dataset used by Jafari-Khouzani and Soltanian-\\nZadeh.7 This dataset contained 100 H&amp;E images of prostate\\ntissue samples. The images were of grades 2 to 5 and the mag-\\nnification was 100 with different sizes. All of the images were\\ncaptured in equal conditions of light. This dataset contained 21,\\n20, 32, and 27 images of grades 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\\nEach image had a single grade. The images were graded by\\nexpert pathologists who provided the ground truth data.\\nSince our CNN experiments needed a large amount of data,\\nwe augmented both datasets. For this purpose, we performed\\nmirroring, patches, rotation, and scaling of the images. For\\nmirroring, we used three mirroring scenarios (horizontal, verti-\\ncal, and horizontal and vertical). For rotation, we rotated each\\nimage 10 times with a rotation randomly chosen between 10 deg\\nand 90 deg. For scaling, we resized each image by a factor of 2.\\nFor extracting patches out of images, we extracted them from\\ntop left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, and center of the\\nimage, each half the size of the original image. We also com-\\nbined the above operations to further augment the datasets.\\nOverall, we were able to augment each original image to 104\\nimages. Therefore, we had 6032 augmented breast tissue images\\nand 10,400 augmented prostate tissue images. Throughout this\\nwhole process, since we had different size images, we resized\\nthe images to 128 × 128 pixels for normalization purposes.\\nFigure 7 shows all 104 augmented images of a sample breast\\ntissue image.\\n3.2\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe had two types of primary features. One was the RGB\\nimages, which were extracted as explained in Sec. 3.1. The\\nother primary features were shearlet features, which were\\nextracted as explained next.\\n3.2.1\\nShearlet feature extraction\\nTo apply shearlet transform on images, we utilized the FFST\\nMATLAB® toolbox provided by Häuser and Steidl.24 We\\nchose five scales (decomposition levels) for shearlet. The first\\ndecomposition level was a low-pass filtered version of input.\\nWe chose eight directions for the second and third levels and\\n16 directions for the fourth and fifth levels which led to 8, 8,\\n16, and 16 subbands, respectively. Therefore, overall we had\\n1 þ 8 þ 8 þ 16 þ 16 ¼ 49 subbands of shearlets. All these sub-\\nbands were of the same size as the input image (150 × 150). We\\nfollowed the procedure explained in Sec. 3.1 to extract the\\nmagnitude [magða; s; tÞ] and phase [phaseða; s; tÞ] of shearlet\\ncoefficients from each subband and fed them to our CNN\\nframework.\\n3.2.2\\nConvolutional neural networks framework and\\nfeature evolution\\nAs\\nwe\\nexplained\\nin\\nSec.\\n2.3,\\nour\\nCNN\\nconsisted\\nof\\nthree layers of convolution and max-pooling. For convolutional\\nlayers, we initialized 64 Gaussian filters of size 5 × 5 with a\\nstandard deviation of 0.0001 and bias of zero. The step between\\neach filter application was 2 pixels. We used an ReLU function\\nas the activation function. For max-pooling layer, we applied it\\non local patch of units inside a 3 × 3 region of input feature map\\nwith a 2 pixels step between pooling regions. We used an LRN\\nlayer to normalize local input regions. We used fully connected\\nlayers for concatenating the outputs of CNNs.\\nWe used the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with the\\nmomentum of 0.9 and the weight decay of 0.05 in all experi-\\nments. We used mini-batches of 32 samples due to the large\\nsize of the network and the memory limitations. All models\\nwere initialized with the learning rate of 0.001. These hyper-\\nparameters were empirically found based on the performance\\nof validation set over onefold of Gleason grading. The same\\nhyperparameters were used for the breast cancer experiment.\\nWe also used dropout layers to prevent the overfitting of the\\nresults to the structure of the CNN. The dropout threshold value\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-7\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nof 0.7 was found to be the best based on the classification accu-\\nracy on validation set.\\nOur primary input features were RGB, magnitude, and phase\\nof shearlet coefficients. Figure 5 shows the overall structure of\\nour deep neural network. Mag1 to Mag5 were the magnitude of\\nshearlet coefficients from decomposition levels 1 to 5, respec-\\ntively. Phases 1 to 5 were the phase of shearlet coefficients from\\ndecomposition level 1 to 5, respectively. We fed each one of our\\ninputs (RGB, Mag1 to Mag5, and phases 1 to 5) to a separate\\nCNN. The reason for separating RGB from shearlet data was\\nbecause they were of a different nature and, therefore, needed\\nseparate processing. We separated the magnitude and phase of\\nshearlets for the same reason. We also processed shearlet coef-\\nficients from different decomposition levels independently\\nbecause different decomposition levels represent features from\\ndifferent scales.\\nFigure 8 visualizes the shearlet feature evolution as they go\\nthrough each convolutional layer. Figures 8(a) and 8(b) show the\\nfirst convolution layer output features for the first and third\\ndecomposition level shearlet coefficients, respectively. The third\\ndecomposition level shearlet coefficients represent more details\\nin the images with more directional sensitivity. Figures 8(c) and\\n8(d) show the same shearlet coefficients out of the second con-\\nvolution. After the second convolution, the features become\\nmore distinguishable.\\n3.3\\nResults\\nWe evaluated our proposed microscopic image classification\\nframework for two tasks: breast cancer diagnosis and prostate\\nGleason grading. Although both tasks contain similar input data\\n(H&amp;E images), they are different in nature. One is to distinguish\\ncancerous from noncancer cells, while the other (i.e., Gleason\\ngrading) is to evaluate how advanced the cancer is. Also,\\nthey belong to different human tissues, therefore, the physiologi-\\ncal and textural information are different. We evaluated our\\nmethod against these different tasks to show the generality\\nand applicability of our method.\\nFor each classification task, RGB images and extracted\\nshearlet features from input images were fed to our CNN frame-\\nwork with the parameters explained in Sec. 3.2.2. For cross val-\\nidation, we used a fivefold cross-validation technique. We\\ndivided our original datasets (nonaugmented) into five sets\\nand used four sets for training and one for testing. We repeated\\nthis five times and reported the average classification accuracy.\\nWe used the augmentation process during the training. The final\\nnetwork is evaluated on the original images only. Therefore, all\\nimages pertaining to a given case are either in the training or test\\nset (not in both). We had three different scenarios for CNN\\nexperiments. In the first scenario, we used only RGB data as\\ninput. In the second scenario, we combined RGB and magnitude\\nof shearlets and used them as input. Lastly, we combined RGB,\\nmagnitude, and phase of shearlets and used them as input to\\nCNN. This helped us understand the contribution of each feature\\nset separately and when combined together. We were able to\\nsignificantly increase the classification accuracy (by 13% for\\nbreast cancer diagnosis and 8% for Gleason grading) by com-\\nbining RGB and magnitude of shearlets. We further improved\\nthe results by including phase information as well. To evaluate\\nthe performance of our deep neural network, we compared the\\nresults with the state-of-the-art methods based on hand-crafted\\nfeatures using SVM. For SVM, we tried different kernels (linear,\\npolynomial, and RBF) with different parameters (polynomial\\norder of 1, 2, and 3 for polynomial kernel and sigma values\\nFig. 7 Augmented images of a sample breast tissue image from our dataset.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-8\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nbetween 1 and 10,000 for Gaussian radial basis function kernel)\\nand chose the best kernel and parameters for each experiment.\\nOur experiments showed that CNN outperforms the hand-\\ncrafted feature extraction methods.\\nTable 1 shows the classification results for breast cancer\\ndiagnosis using our deep neural network method and state-of-\\nthe-art methods.

Similar\\nto breast cancer diagnosis, by including the magnitude and\\nphase of shearlet coefficients we improved the classification\\naccuracy.

A confusion\\nmatrix is a table that is used to visualize the performance of\\na classifier using true and predicted labels. Since we have\\nfour classes in Gleason grading (grades 1 to 4), our confusion\\nmatrix is 4 × 4. It is noticeable that using our proposed method\\nthe misclassified cases only belong to Gleason grade 5. This is in\\naccordance with the pathologists diagnosis since distinguishing\\ngrade 5 from grade 4 is the most difficult task in Gleason\\ngrading.8 Our CNN method is 15% better than hand-crafted\\nTable 2\\nClassification results for Gleason grading (mean � std).\\nMethod\\nSensitivity\\nSpecificity\\nF-1 Score\\nAUC\\nAccuracy\\nRGB\\n0.80 � 0.02\\n0.91 � 0.01\\n0.71 � 0.01\\n0.72 � 0.02\\n0.76 � 0.06\\nRGB + magnitude of shearlets\\n0.84 � 0.01\\n0.91 � 0.02\\n0.81 � 0.03\\n0.79 � 0.02\\n0.84 � 0.04\\nRGB + magnitude + phase of shearlets\\n0.89 � 0.01\\n0.94 � 0.01\\n0.85 � 0.02\\n0.84 � 0.01\\n0.88 � 0.05\\nJafari-Khouzani and Soltanian-Zadeh7\\n0.82 � 0.01\\n0.91 � 0.02\\n0.73 � 0.02\\n0.78 � 0.02\\n0.83 � 0.09\\nRezaeilouyeh et al.10\\n0.78 � 0.03\\n0.91 � 0.01\\n0.69 � 0.03\\n0.74 � 0.01\\n0.78 � 0.11\\nWavelet packet35\\n0.82 � 0.02\\n0.92 � 0.01\\n0.73 � 0.01\\n0.74 � 0.02\\n0.78 � 0.07\\nCo-occurrence matrix36\\n0.81 � 0.01\\n0.92 � 0.01\\n0.72 � 0.02\\n0.73 � 0.02\\n0.77 � 0.09\\nNote: Bold values indicate the best results.\\nFig. 9 ROC curves for breast cancer diagnosis experiment using\\nthe best hand-crafted feature extraction method9 and our best deep\\nneural network results.\\nTable 3 Confusion matrix (%) for Gleason grading experiment using\\nthe best hand-crafted feature extraction method7.\\nTrue label\\nGrade 2\\nGrade 3\\nGrade 4\\nGrade 5\\nGrade 2\\n100\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nGrade 3\\n0\\n100\\n0\\n0\\nGrade 4\\n0\\n3\\n97\\n0\\nGrade 5\\n0\\n33\\n26\\n41\\nPredicted label\\nTable 4 Confusion matrix (%) for Gleason grading experiment using\\nour deep neural network.\\nTrue label\\nGrade 2\\nGrade 3\\nGrade 4\\nGrade 5\\nGrade 2\\n100\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nGrade 3\\n0\\n100\\n0\\n0\\nGrade 4\\n0\\n0\\n100\\n0\\nGrade 5\\n7\\n0\\n37\\n56\\nPredicted label\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-10\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nfeatures in distinguishing between grades 4 and 5 (41% versus\\n56%). In addition, using hand-crafted feature extraction meth-\\nods,7 there are some misclassifications between grades 4 and 3\\nin addition to grades 4 and 5, which proves the advantage of\\nour method.\\n4\\nDiscussions and Conclusions\\nEarly diagnosis of cancer and grading its severity are very\\nimportant tasks that can save a patients’ life. Automating this\\nprocess can help pathologists to have a faster and more reliable\\ndiagnosis. Most of the automatic cancer diagnosis and grading\\ntechniques use hand-crafted features that need to be fine-tuned\\nfor different tasks.\\nIn this paper, we proposed a framework for automatic breast\\ncancer detection and prostate Gleason grading. First, we\\nextracted the magnitude and phase of complex shearlet coeffi-\\ncients from the histological images. Shearlet transform is a mul-\\ntiscale directional system that has proven itself suitable for\\ntexture analysis of microscopic images in our previous studies.\\nThen we combined the shearlet features with imagery data and\\nused them to train CNNs. This feature learning process further\\nenhanced the features and made them more discriminative. Then\\nwe used softmax classifier to distinguish different microscopic\\nimages. We were able to achieve high-classification accuracy on\\nboth breast cancer and Gleason grading datasets using our pro-\\nposed method. We also compared our method against state-of-\\nthe-art methods that use hand-crafted features. We were able to\\noutperform those methods in both cases.\\nOne of the main advantages of our method is that it does not\\nmake any assumptions beforehand about the visual features of\\ncancerous tissues. We consider shearlet transform as a general\\nmathematical tool and extract features without any hand-craft-\\ning. Our deep neural network takes care of the feature learning\\ntask. Future work includes exploring the possibility of using\\ndeeper architectures for CNN and also expanding the applica-\\ntions of our method to different medical image analysis tasks.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis research was supported by the National Science Founda-\\ntion with Grant No. IIP-1230556.

It commonly arises in patients with established liver disease and \\nthe diagnosis often occurs at an advanced stage. Genetic variations, such as single \\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may alter disease risk and thus may have use \\nas predictive markers of disease outcome. The aims of this study were (i) to assess \\nthe association of two SNPs, rs430397 in GRP78 and rs738409 in PNPLA3 with the \\nrisk of developing HCC in a Sicilian association cohort and, (ii) to use a machine \\nlearning technique to establish a predictive combinatorial phenotypic model for HCC \\nincluding rs430397 and rs738409 genotypes and clinical and laboratory attributes. \\nThe controls comprised of 304 healthy subjects while the cases comprised of 170 HCC \\npatients the majority of whom had hepatitis C (HCV)–related cirrhosis. Significant \\nassociations were identified between the risk of developing HCC and both rs430397 \\n(p=0.0095) and rs738409 (p=0.0063). The association between rs738409 and HCC \\nwas significantly stronger in the HCV positive cases. In the best prediction model, \\nrepresented graphically by a decision tree with an acceptable misclassification rate of \\n17.0%, the A/A and G/A genotypes of the rs430397 variant were fixed and combined \\nwith the three rs738409 genotypes; the attributes were age, sex and alcohol. These \\nresults demonstrate significant associations between both rs430397 and rs738409 and \\nHCC development in a Sicilian cohort. The combinatorial predictive model developed \\nto include these genetic variants may, if validated in independent cohorts, allow for \\nearlier diagnosis of HCC.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most \\ncommon of the primary liver cancers. It is the fifth most \\ncommon malignancy worldwide and the third most frequent \\ncause of cancer-related deaths [1–3]. The epidemiology of \\nHCC is complex reflecting, to a large extent, differences \\nin levels of exposure to known predisposing factors \\nsuch as the presence of cirrhosis, chronic infection \\nwith hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus \\n(HCV) and environmental toxin exposure. Prevalence \\nrates are 16 to 32 times higher in economically less- \\n                  Research Paper\\nOncotarget\\n86792\\nwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\\ndeveloped countries such as sub-Saharan Africa South-east \\nAsia and China [4]. In Eastern Asia the major risk factor \\nfor HCC is infection with hepatitis B [5, 6], whereas in \\nNorthern and Western Europe excess alcohol consumption \\nand infection with HCV are the main antecedents [3]. In \\ndeveloped countries HCC develops most frequently in \\npatients with established cirrhosis whereas elsewhere HCC \\nmay arise in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection \\nat a pre-cirrhotic stage [7, 8]. There are also data to support \\na role for tobacco smoking, diabetes and obesity as risk \\nfactors or risk co-factors for the development of HCC [9]. \\nFinally there are important gender differences in HCC \\nprevalence; men are at two- to five-fold increased risk of \\ndeveloping this malignancy than women, depending on \\ngeographic area, which most likely reflect their increased \\nexposures to known risk factors [1].\\nAs the epidemiology of HCC has become better \\nunderstood, so has the fact that only 5 to 20% of the \\npopulations potentially at risk actually develop HCC. \\nInterest has, therefore, turned to the identification of \\nthe factors responsible for the differences in individual \\nsusceptibility; in particular the role of genetic variation. \\nTwo of the most notable genetic findings to date have \\nbeen the association between the Single Nucleotide \\nPolymorphisms (SNP), rs430397 and rs738409, with HCC \\nrisk. The rs430397 variant in glucose regulated protein \\n78 (GRP78 also known as HSPA5) has been associated \\nwith HCC and cirrhosis risk in Chinese populations with \\nHBV infection [10, 11]. There is considerable functional \\nand genetic evidence implicating the GRP78 protein in \\nmechanisms of HCC carcinogenesis [12, 13] and indeed in \\nmalignancies at other sites [14, 15]. The rs738409 variant in \\npatatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) \\nhas been identified as conferring a significant risk for \\ndeveloping cirrhosis in relation to non-alcohol-related fatty \\nliver disease [16] and alcohol-related liver disease [17]. \\nThe rs738409 variant not only contributes to liver injury, \\nbut also to the risk of development of subsequent HCC [18, \\n19]. The nature of the association between the rs738409 \\nvariant in HCV-related HCC is less well characterized \\nthan in HCC of other aetiologies possibly because there is \\nsignificant heterogeneity in the study populations in which \\nthis variant has been studied [20].\\nVariants in GRP78 and PNPLA3 have been \\nassociated with HCC risk in populations of diverse \\nancestry and with HCC of diverse aetiology. It is not \\nknown, however what proportion of the variance in \\nHCC risk can be attributed to genetic factors in Southern \\nEuropean populations in whom the main risk factor for \\nthe development of HCC is chronic HCV infection and \\nthe incidence is rising [9]. Further, it is widely recognized \\nthat HCC risk prediction in chronic liver disease will have \\nclinical utility in guiding evidence-based decisions about \\npatient management [21] but it is unclear as to whether \\ngenetic information could improve the predictive models. \\nMachine learning techniques have the potential to improve \\nthe accuracy of predictive models using genetic data [22]. \\nA number of machine learning techniques have been \\ndeveloped, but all make use of computer algorithms that \\nimprove predictive accuracy with experience. Decision \\ntree algorithms in particular are a well-established \\ntechnique, which are useful for exploratory analysis and \\nmodel visualisation.\\nThe aims of the present study were therefore to \\nassess, whether (i) two genetic variants in PNPLA3 and \\nGRP78 are associated with the risk of developing HCC \\nin a Sicilian population, and (ii) whether inclusion of \\ngenotypic information would contribute to a predictive \\nmodel designed to stratify patients by HCC risk.\\nRESULTS\\nCohort characteristics\\nThe cases were significantly older than the healthy \\ncontrols (mean ± 1SD age 70.2± 8.0 vs. 56.6 ± 8.1 years; \\np = 2.2 x 10-16) and comprised of proportionately fewer \\nmen (70.4% vs. 58.2%, p = 0.007) (Table 1). All but one \\nof the cases had established cirrhosis; in the majority \\nchronic HCV infection was the aetiological agent (Table \\n1). A small proportion of patients (n=12; 7%), had marked \\nsteatosis in addition to cirrhosis. Up to 40% of the cases \\nhad experienced a major complication of chronic liver \\ndisease; and the majority had features of hepatocellular \\ndysfunction with poor synthetic and excretory function \\n(Table 2). Features of cirrhosis were evident on imaging in \\nall included cases; ultrasonography was the modality most \\nfrequently employed (Table 2). The diagnosis of HCC was \\nmade in the majority on the basis of multimodal imaging; \\nless than a quarter of patients had an elevated serum alpha-\\nfetoprotein level (Table 3).\\nGenotyping quality\\nThe genotyping success rate was greater than 95% \\nfor both variants, with genotype distributions showing no \\nevidence for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in \\ncontrols (p &gt;0.05). The minor and major allele designations \\nof both rs430397 and rs738409 were generally similar in \\nthis Sicilian ancestry cohort to those in reference Europeans \\nancestry groups [23]; however, the minor allele (G) of \\nrs738409 was noticeably more frequent in Sicilian controls \\nthan in European reference populations.\\nGRP78 and PNPLA3 polymorphisms and HCC\\nBoth rs430397 in GRP78 and rs738409 in PNPLA3 \\nwere significantly associated with HCC risk in this Sicilian \\nancestry cohort (Table 4). The association between \\nrs430397 in GRP78 and HCC risk is best described by a \\ndominant model (AA+AG vs. GG), (p= 0.0095, OR= 1.81) \\nwhereas the association between rs738409 in PNPLA3 is \\nOncotarget\\n86793\\nwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\\nbest described by a recessive model (GG vs. CG +CC), \\n(p= 6.28x10-3, OR= 2.56) (Table 5).\\nWhen the analyses were confined to cases with \\nHCC related to chronic HCV infection there was no \\nevidence of association between rs430397 in GRP78 \\nand HCC risk (Table 5). Because the frequency of the \\nrs430397: AA genotype in this stratified cohort was \\nvery low, an association test under a recessive model of \\ninheritance (AA vs. AG+GG) could not be performed \\nusing logistic regression. In contrast, the magnitude of the \\nassociation between rs738409 in PNPLA3 and HCC risk \\nincreased when confined to the HCV positive HCC cases \\n(p=2.41x10-3, OR=2.82) (Table 5). There was no evidence \\nfor an epistatic interaction between the two variants and \\nHCC risk (Pasymptotic = 0.8, ORinteraction = 1.08). None of the \\ndemographic, clinical, laboratory or diagnostic variables \\nwas associated with either the GRP78 or PNPLA3 \\ngenotypes (Table 6).\\nTable 1: Characteristics of the healthy controls and HCC cases included in the genetic association study\\nVariable\\nControls (n=304)\\nHCC cases (n=170)\\nAge at diagnosis (yr)\\n56.6 ± 8.1\\n70.2 ± 8.0\\nGender\\n Men\\n214 (70.4)\\n99 (58.2)\\n Women\\n90 (29.6)\\n71 (41.8)\\nAetiology of Liver Disease\\n HCV\\n144 (84.7)\\n Alcohol\\n10 (5.9)\\n Cryptogenic\\n10 (5.9)\\n HBV\\n9 (5.3)\\n Dysmetabolic syndrome\\n1 (0.6)\\nData are mean ± 1SD or number (%)\\nAbbreviations: HCV- hepatitis C virus;

Further the possibility that these risk-associated \\ngenetic variants could be used to prediction the development \\nof HCC on an individual patient basis was explored, using a \\nmachine learning technique, with promising results.\\nRs430397 lies in the fifth intron of GRP78. It has \\nbeen associated with HCC risk in Chinese with HBV \\ninfection [10, 11] but does not appear to have been studied \\nin European populations previously. As a non-protein-\\ncoding SNP, it could influence gene/protein function by \\naltering gene expression but there is no direct evidence, to \\ndate, that this variant has functional effects. However, it \\ndoes not lie in a GRP78 gene region associated with high \\ntranscriptional activity [25] nor in a CpG island associated \\nwith epigenetic mechanisms of gene silencing (T.

It has also been reported to \\nsustain cell survival, to inhibit apoptosis and to promote \\nthe invasion and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro [28–31]. \\nHowever, the precise role of GRP78 in the development of \\ncancer is still not clear [32, 33].\\nRs738409 lies in the third exon of PNPLA3 and \\nencodes a nonsynonymous alteration in the protein \\nsequence (Ile148Met). This SNP came to prominence \\nwhen identified as a risk factor for the progression of non-\\nalcohol related fatty liver disease [16] and the development \\nof alcohol-related cirrhosis [17]. Subsequently, the risk \\nallele of rs738409 was shown to be associated with the \\ndevelopment of HCC in patients of European descent \\nwith established cirrhosis [20]. Rs738409 has also been \\nassociated with the development of HCC in East Asian \\npopulations [34, 35]. The risk allele of rs738409 has \\nalso been studied in relation to HCV-related liver injury, \\nalthough associations are less consistent [36, 37]. The \\nresults of the present study show that the rs738409:G allele \\nis a significant risk for HCC in the Sicilian population. \\nThe fact that the strength of the association was increased \\nin the subgroup with HCV-related cirrhosis with an \\neffect size that exceeds that in many other studies is of \\ninterest but has to be weighed against the fact that these \\nindividuals comprised almost 85% of the study population.\\nDespite the substantial genetic evidence implicating \\nrs738409 and PNPLA3 with cirrhosis and HCC of different \\naetiologies, the function of the PNPLA3 protein remains \\nuncertain as does the effect of the Ile148Met substitution. \\nThe 148Met risk allele appears to promote intracellular \\ntriglyceride retention [38] but the functional changes that \\nlead to the development of significant liver damage and \\nHCC remain to be established. Of interest the association \\nbetween rs738409 and liver disease progression appears \\nto be independent of the severity of liver fat accumulation \\n[20, 39]. Further, the functional effects of this variant may \\ndirectly or indirectly regulate the release of molecules \\nFigure 3: Decision tree developed fixing the rs430397 A/A and G/A genotypes.

This difference in allele \\nfrequency could reflect genetic isolation of the population \\nof Sicily. However, a recent study has shown that Sicilians \\nare genetically similar to mainland Italians from the \\nadjacent regions [44]. Another potential explanation for \\nthis observation could be cryptic underlying population \\nstratification, which may have arisen due to the use of blood-\\ndonor controls. Despite this, similar blood-donor controls are \\nused in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control consortium cohort \\n[45] with little evidence to suggest significant population \\nstratification in their analyses.\\nThere was no evidence, in the present study, of an \\nepistatic interaction between the GRP78 and PNPLA3 \\nvariants in relation to HCC risk. In addition there were \\nno significant associations between either variant and any \\nclinical features or the results of any of the laboratory \\ninvestigation. However, combinations of these various \\nattributes together with the rs430397 and rs738409 \\ngenotypes were used to produce a model, graphically \\ndisplayed as a decision tree, which could be useful for \\npredicting subjects at risk for developing HCC, at least \\nwithin this study population. The best prediction model \\nused only age, sex and alcohol as the additional required \\nvariables and was represented by a decision tree with a \\nMCR of 17.0%.\\nIn conclusion: rs430397 in GRP78 and rs738409 in \\nPNPLA3 are risk factors for the development of HCC in \\na Southern Italian population of cases with predominantly \\nHCV-related cirrhosis. Use of a machine-learning \\napproach allowed development of a prediction model \\nincorporating phenotypic, clinical and genotypic variables. \\nThis computational approach needs to be further explored \\nand the predictions independently validated. If confirmed, \\nthis approach could be used to identify individuals at risk \\nat an early stage thereby facilitating monitoring and, when \\nrequired, early intervention.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nStudy populations\\nThe 170 HCC cases were enrolled at the Department \\nof Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties of the \\nPoliclinico Hospital, Palermo, Italy. All had been born \\nin Sicily and continued to reside there. The aetiology \\nof the liver disease was determined using historical, \\nclinical, laboratory, imaging and histological information. \\nThe diagnosis of cirrhosis and HCC were made based \\non previously reported criteria [46], and international \\nguidelines [47]. In the majority of instances the diagnosis \\nof cirrhosis was based on historical, clinical, laboratory \\nand radiological variables; histological confirmation was \\navailable in a minority from liver biopsy material obtained \\nvia the percutaneous route (Table 2). The diagnosis of \\nHCC was based on historical, clinical, and laboratory \\nvariables together with, as recommended, multimodal \\nimaging (Table 3). The 304 healthy blood donors, who \\nacted as controls, were recruited at the Azienda di Rilievo \\nNazionale ad Alta Specialiazzione (A.R.N.A.S.) Civico \\nHospital of Palermo, Italy. Controls were only included if \\nthey were born in and continued to reside in Sicily; were \\naged &gt; 30 years and in line with International guidelines \\n[48, 49] were negative for HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti HIV \\nantibodies and had normal routine blood test results.\\nAll included cases and controls provided written \\ninformed consent. This research was approved by the \\nEthics committee of the Policlinico Hospital (Palermo, \\nItaly).\\nDNA extraction and genotyping\\nGenomic DNA was extracted from whole \\nblood using the WizardGenomic DNA Purification \\nKit (Promega). DNA quality was assessed using gel \\nelectrophoresis (0.8% agarose gel; 5 volts/cm for 1 hour; \\n1× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer; 100 bp and 1kb DNA \\nLadder (Promega, UK). Genotyping for rs430397 in \\nGRP78 and rs738409 in PNPLA3 was performed using \\nthe K-Biosciences Competitive Allele Specific PCR (LGC \\nGenomics, Hoddesdon, UK) platform with amplification \\nand detection undertaken using a LightCycler® 480 real-\\ntime PCR system (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Burgess \\nHill, UK). Genotype calling was performed automatically \\nusing proprietary software with minor manual editing of \\ngenotype calls. Approximately 12% of samples, randomly \\nselected a priori, were genotyped in duplicate to ensure \\nconsistent genotype calling. The primers used for KASPar \\ngenotyping are detailed in Supplementary Table 1.\\nStatistical analysis\\nGenetic analysis\\nTests for genetic association, missingness, deviation \\nfrom Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and epistasis were \\nperformed using PLINK (version 1.9) [50]. Genetic \\nassociation analyses were performed using logistic \\nregression utilizing additive, dominant and recessive \\nmodels when comparing HCC cases and controls. Tests \\nfor association between demographic covariates were \\nperformed under an additive model using the Fisher’s \\nexact test to assess significance. Statistical analyses were \\nperformed in R [51].\\nPrediction modelling\\nA two-step analysis comprising of variable \\nselection and decision tree construction was performed \\nOncotarget\\n86800\\nwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\\nusing a machine learning technique to establish a rule \\nfor predicting phenotypes starting from the genotypes of \\nboth the rs430397 and rs738409 variants. In the first step \\nthe variables to be used in the second step were selected \\nutilizing a stepwise search, which performs a greedy \\nforward or backward search through the space of HCC \\ncase characteristics or attributes. The selection is based on \\na decision tree classifier for estimating the accuracy of the \\nchosen variable subset and is stopped when the addition/\\ndeletion of any remaining attribute resulted in a decrease \\nin evaluation. The second step involved the construction \\nof a tree-like graph or model of decisions based on the \\npreviously selected variables. This model exhibits a \\nflowchart-like structure in which each internal node \\nrepresents a ‘test’ on an attribute, each branch represents \\nthe outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a \\nclass label. The paths from root to leaves represent the \\nclassification rules. The evaluation of the classifier is \\nbased on the overall misclassification rate (MCR); the \\nlower the MCR the better the prediction modelling. Both \\nsteps were performed using the RWeka package (R-3.2.3 \\nsoftware).\\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\\nNone of the authors declare a conflicts of interest.\\nGRANT SUPPORT\\nMV is supported by a My First Associazione \\nItaliana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) Grant-AIRC Grant \\nNo.13419, by UCL and by grants No. LQ1605 (MEYS \\nCR) and FNUSA-ICRC No. CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0123 \\n(OP VaVpI).\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

To assess FoG, current clinical practice mostly employs repeated evaluations over\\nweeks and months based on questionnaires, which may not accurately map the severity of\\nthis symptom. The use of a non-invasive system to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL)\\nand the PD symptoms experienced by patients throughout the day could provide a more\\naccurate and objective evaluation of FoG in order to better understand the evolution of the\\ndisease and allow for a more informed decision-making process in making adjustments to\\nthe patient’s treatment plan. This paper presents a new algorithm to detect FoG with a\\nmachine learning approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a single tri-axial\\naccelerometer worn at the waist. The method is evaluated through the acceleration signals\\nin an outpatient setting gathered from 21 PD patients at their home and evaluated under two\\ndifferent conditions: first, a generic model is tested by using a leave-one-out approach and,\\nsecond, a personalised model that also uses part of the dataset from each patient. Results\\nshow a significant improvement in the accuracy of the personalised model compared to the\\ngeneric model, showing enhancement in the specificity and sensitivity geometric mean\\n(GM) of 7.2%. Furthermore, the SVM approach adopted has been compared to the most\\ncomprehensive FoG detection method currently in use (referred to as MBFA in this paper).\\nResults of our novel generic method provide an enhancement of 11.2% in the GM compared\\nto the MBFA generic model and, in the case of the personalised model, a 10% of improve-\\nment with respect to the MBFA personalised model.

According to the Global Declaration for Parkinson’s Disease, PD affects up to 6.3 million\\npeople worldwide [1]. Among the many PD symptoms, Freezing of Gait (FoG) is one of the\\nmost incapacitating and is usually present in the more advanced phase of the disease [2,3].\\nFoG is commonly described by PD patients as if their feet were “glued to the floor” resulting in\\nloss of postural balance frequently causing falls [4,5]. In addition to the motor complications\\narising from FoG, it can also lead to non-motor complications including social isolation,\\ndepression, and anxiety. [6,7].\\nThe precise tracking of the occurrence of FoG is challenging for clinicians. The acquisition\\nof such information can greatly help in optimising therapies including pharmacotherapy, and\\nphysiotherapy, that are known to be beneficial for reducing FoG episodes [4]. Furthermore, by\\nacquiring accurate information on FoG frequency and severity in conjunction with the full\\nrepertoire of other motor and non-motor symptomatology, this would provide to the neurolo-\\ngists a more accurate overall view of the disease status and evolution over time. Additionally,\\nthe online detection of FoG opens up the possibility of incorporating actuation methodologies\\nsuch as rhythmic auditory cues that might shorten or prevent FoG episodes [8,9]. These rhyth-\\nmic auditory cues are hereafter referred to as cueing.\\nIn clinical practice, there are two methods employed to evaluate the presence of FoG. The\\nfirst is based on specific gait tests, for example the Timed Up &amp; Go test performed through a\\nnarrow space, using specific circuits with several turns [10–12] or by assessing patients while\\nperforming rapid and short steps [13]. The second method is based on answers given by\\npatients and caregivers about the frequency and severity of FoG episodes collected in specific\\nFoG questionnaires [14–16]. These methods have major drawbacks due to both the clinical set-\\nting not reflecting real life settings as well as the timing of the evaluation not replicating the\\nrecognised variability in FOG frequency. FoG episodes often occur in the patient’s own home\\nand their frequency is reduced significantly in controlled environments such as the laboratory\\nsetting [17]. Self-assessment of FoG, has shown to be unreliable since patients and caregivers\\nmay not perceive the episodes and, furthermore, because PD patients often experience mem-\\nory loss, inattention or dementia, leading to imprecise recall [18].\\nTherefore, many attempts have been made to obtain an objective and precise method for\\nmonitoring FoG in patients during their normal activities of daily living (ADL). In this con-\\ntext, many different types of sensors have been employed. The most widespread method to\\nobjectively detect FoG is based on the analysis of data emanating from wearable motion sen-\\nsors, as they are unobtrusive, portable with low power consumption, providing currently the\\nmost suitable way to evaluate FoG episodes in patients’ own homes.\\nMost methods to detect FoG based on wearable sensors have been developed and tested\\nunder controlled conditions [19–27], which is mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining a valid\\ngold standard outside the laboratory setting. Therefore, trained algorithms are likely to gener-\\nate several false positives when they are tested in real life since algorithms have not been\\ntrained for specific situations that could happen in patients daily living activities. As far as the\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n2 / 26\\nFunding: This project has been performed within\\nthe framework of the \"Freezing in Parkinson’s\\nDisease: Improving Quality of Life with an\\nAutomatic Control System\" (MASPARK) project\\nwhich is funded by La Fundacio´ La Marato´ de TV3\\n20140431 [http://www.tv3.cat/marato/es/\\nprojectes_financats_2013].

This does not\\nalter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on\\nsharing data and materials.\\nauthors are aware, only Ahlrichs et al. have generated an algorithm to detect FoG in PD\\npatients’ own homes [28]; however, part of the evaluation was not performed with PD patients\\nwith FoG and the latency time of the algorithm was every minute, which is too slow to be effec-\\ntive for cueing purposes. Until now, objective FoG assessment during ADLs in the home has\\nnot been extensively examined, thus, it might not be reliable. The usability and acceptability of\\nany new wearable device is critical to its success. Many studies have employed several sensors\\nat specific locations (Table 1) providing promising results in some cases. However, their usage\\nmay be counterproductive when monitoring FoG at home, as they require patients to wear\\nmany sensors, reducing the usability of the monitoring system and its acceptability. Thus, the\\ntrade-off between accuracy and usability is a key factor in designing such systems. The waist is\\none of the most suitable placements for detecting FoG [28–31]. Furthermore, according to\\nMathie et al., locating a wearable system at a side of the waist is the most comfortable place, as\\nconcluded in a questionnaire performed by elderly people [32]. Additionally, in humans the\\nwaist is close to the centre of gravity better representing body movement [33] and also allowing\\nthe sensor to monitor other PD symptoms such as bradykinesia or dyskinesia [34,35].\\nThis paper presents a study performed within the ‘Freezing in Parkinson’s Disease: Improv-\\ning Quality of Life with an Automatic Control System’ (MASPARK) project [36] for detecting\\nFoG by locating a single wearable sensor at the waist. More specifically, this paper presents a\\nnew machine learning based algorithm to detect FoG episodes validated by clinical experts, in\\nPD patients’ own home [37]. Furthermore, and with the aim of evaluating the algorithm in\\nreal life, the proposed algorithm is also designed with the purpose of being implemented in a\\nmicrocontroller, thus, some issues in the computational resources used by the method such as\\nwindowing and the classification cost have also been taken into account. The approach pre-\\nsented here is compared to the most extended algorithm used to detect FoG (hereafter referred\\nto as the Moore-Bächlin FoG Algorithm, MBFA) [21]. The validation methodology employed\\nfor both approaches consists of a Leave-One-Patient-Out. Furthermore, this leave one out\\nanalysis is compared to a user-dependent algorithm, in which an individualised model classi-\\nfier is evaluated. Results on 21 PD patients show that the generic proposed approach outper-\\nforms the current most employed FoG detection method by an average 11%, with a sensitivity\\nof 74.7% (proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as positives) and specificity\\nof 79% (proportion of actual negatives correctly identified as negatives) compared to a sensitiv-\\nity of 81.6% and specificity of 52.6%. In addition, personalisation of the detection model\\nachieves an improvement in the symptom detection of around 10% on average (80.1 on sensi-\\ntivity, 88.1% on specificity against an 89.1% on sensitivity and 61.5% on specificity). Thus, a\\nmachine learning approach can be used to monitor FoG during the daily life of PD patients\\nand, furthermore, personalised models for FoG detection can be used to improve the monitor-\\ning accuracy.\\nThe paper is organised as follows: first a background with the most relevant FoG detection\\nsystems and algorithms is introduced, then the proposed methodologies, the experiments per-\\nformed and the evaluation of the algorithms are presented, and finally, the results, discussion\\nand conclusions are provided.\\nRelated work\\nFoG has been analysed with a wide variety of systems and sensors. Some of these reports have\\nemployed systems to capture FoG episodes that are not transferable to normal daily life of\\npatients since they can only be used in a laboratory setting.

Other obtrusive system exam-\\nples are knee-joint goniometers [23] or cameras and video systems, which also have a low\\nacceptability by users in a non-laboratory setting [23,39,44]. Thus, given that PD monitoring\\nshould be ambulatory and should last several hours in order to provide useful clinical informa-\\ntion [34,45], most works have employed non-invasive systems such as wearable systems based\\nin microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).\\nIn 2003, Han et al. used MEMS based inertial systems, i.e. accelerometers, to explore fea-\\ntures to analyse FoG episodes. They found that the frequency response in 2 patients wearing\\naccelerometers at the ankle was around 6–8 Hz [19]. In 2008, Moore et al. proposed a method-\\nology for detecting FoG with an accelerometer at the ankle where they described the Freezing\\nIndex (FI), which is the quotient of the power spectral density (PSD) from 3 to 8 Hz (Freezing\\nBand, FB) and the PSD from 0.5 to 3 Hz (Walking Band, WB) [21]. When the FI exceeds an\\nidentified threshold (Freezing Threshold, FTH), a FoG episode is considered to have occurred.\\nDue to the presence of false positives (FP) when the patient is at rest, Ba¨chlin et al., in 2009,\\nintroduced the Power Index (PI), defined as the addition of WB and FB, which was compared\\nto the Power Threshold (PTH) to establish if there was any relevant quantity of movement\\nwhen FI was high [21]. PI indicates the amount of movement, therefore, situations where\\npatients were not moving voluntarily were eliminated. In this final algorithm, a FoG episode is\\nthen determined to occur if FI&gt;FTH and PI&gt;PTH. The MBFA algorithm is the most\\nadvanced FoG detection algorithm due to its low computational cost and good performance\\n[22–24,26,27,31,46–50].\\nThe MBFA algorithm has been widely employed to analyse FoG, although usually in labora-\\ntory conditions and very often with low patient numbers. Jovanov et al. implemented this algo-\\nrithm in real time, although only one patient was used to test the algorithm. Furthermore, no\\nresults on sensitivity and specificity were reported [22]. Zabaleta et al. analysed FoG by means\\nof a triaxial accelerometer and a biaxial gyroscope in different locations of the lower limbs.\\nThe main features employed were the FI in conjunction with power spectral densities changes.\\nThey were capable of correctly detecting 82.7% of FoG episodes with inertial sensors located at\\neach ankle, though only in 2 PD patients [24]. Other attempts to analyse FoG include Stamata-\\nkis et al. [51] and Takac et al.[44], but they only used one patient to test the system for PD gait\\nextraction and a system for contextualising FoG events, respectively.\\nIn recent years, Niazmand et al. (2011) presented the Mimed-pants [26], a washable jogging\\npants with five integrated accelerometers. They employed MBFA for detecting FoG achieving\\nan 88.3% on sensitivity and 85.3% on specificity in 6 PD patients in a short and controlled test\\nfocused on inducing FoG regardless of a false positives test. In a recent work in 2012, Zhao\\net al. [46] performed an embedded algorithm based in the MBFA approach within the Mimed-\\npants system obtaining 81% for sensitivity with 8 PD patients using similar tests. More\\nrecently, Mazilu et al. proposed new online algorithms using 3 accelerometers and comparing\\ndifferent machine learning classifiers that exploit MBFA features, as well as few other ones, in\\nTable 1.

Results obtained showed higher than 95% for specificity and sensitivity\\nwith different classifiers. However, tests were performed under controlled conditions and, fur-\\nthermore, the validation methodology overestimated the performance measures since classifi-\\ners were trained, iteratively, with all window signals available from a patient except for one\\nwindow, which was used to obtain the performance values. Therefore, training and testing pat-\\nterns were very similar, which is very different from normal ADLs. Thus, the reported specific-\\nities and sensitivities would be expected to dramatically decrease free-living conditions. In\\n2013, Moore et al. published their most recent work focused on the MBFA. In this work, they\\ncompared different configurations applying the same algorithm on 25 PD patients, among\\nwhom 20 had FoG episodes. Different window sizes, sensor locations, and different values for\\nFTH and PTH were evaluated in order to find the optimal conditions. Results showed better\\nperformances with longer windows; however, with a long window size, Moore et al. reported a\\nrelevant loss of sensitivity at short episodes that, paradoxically, are the most frequent in PD\\npatients [27]. In a more complex test than the one performed previously [20] using up to 7 sen-\\nsors and a longer test protocol, they achieved sensitivity and specificity over 70% but, in some\\nconfigurations (window size: 7.5s) with the system worn on the back of the waist, both sensitiv-\\nities and specificities were over 80%. In a different approach, Tripoliti et al. proved different\\nfeatures and locations in order to also know the best configuration [52]. The work was per-\\nformed with 5 PD patients and under controlled conditions, with a specific protocol designed\\nto elicit FoG and without FP protocol tests. In this work, they also used 2 gyroscopes along\\nwith 6 accelerometers located in different body parts. With all the sensors worn, they obtained\\nan accuracy of 96.11%, 98.74% of specificity and 81.94% of sensitivity with a leave-one-\\npatient-out method. On the other hand, with a single IMU on the waist they report a 75% of\\nsensitivity and 95% of specificity, although the algorithm is not compared with any other\\nmethod under the same conditions.\\nIn a more recent study from Mazilu’s group, they investigated unsupervised feature learn-\\ning for building an optimal input vector for a decision tree classifier with the DAPHNET proj-\\nect dataset (10 PD patients). Their approach was compared to an analogous MBFA method in\\nwhich the FI and the energy of the spectral band between 0.5Hz and 8Hz were evaluated. The\\ntraining and testing was user-dependent and under controlled conditions. Results enhanced\\nthe similar MBFA method by up to 8.1% in terms of F1-score. Another approach was pre-\\nsented by Rodrı´guez et al. who proposed a method to contextualise FoG episodes by means of\\nan activity recognition algorithm, which rejected those false positives when the patient was sit-\\nting and performed activities such as drawing or typing on a laptop. The specificity was\\nimproved by up to 5% on average reaching an enhancement of 11.9% in some cases [50]. How-\\never, this added-contextualisation method did not contribute to enhanced sensitivity. Other\\nworks have studied the variability of gait between a FoG episode and normal gait. Although\\nthe results are interesting, they failed to include false positive results and a reliable classification\\nwas not performed [53,54]. A recent paper by Zach et al. presented a new methodology to elicit\\nFoG under laboratory conditions which was evaluated with the MBFA algorithm obtaining\\n75% on sensitivity and 76% on specificity [31].\\nFinally, Ahlrichs et al., within the REMPARK project [55], used Support Vector Machines\\n(SVM) for detecting FoG episodes in 8 patients with PD at their own homes. The method\\nincluded tests in different motor states and used a single accelerometer at the waist, achieving\\naccuracies of over 90%. However, specificity was only computed with non-FoG patients,\\nwhich could lead to unreliable predictions since the models were not tested with PD patients\\nwith FoG who move slightly differently to those patients without FoG [30]. Furthermore, the\\nevaluation was performed over a single minute, which is considered too long if cueing is desir-\\nable [28].\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n6 / 26\\nTables 1 and 2 summarise the methods presented in the work we have highlighted.\\nMethods\\nThis section describes the new approach proposed by the authors to detect FoG with a super-\\nvised machine learning technique and the experimental methods used to evaluate it.

The experimental protocol was part of the REMPARK project [55],\\nwhich grouped a total of 92 patients with PD (36 women, 56 men) from 4 health centres in\\nEurope, Centro Me´dico Teknon (Spain), Maccabi Healthcare Services (Israel), Fondazione\\nSanta Lucia (Italy) and National University of Galway (Ireland) [61].\\nIn REMPARK’s experimental protocol, all patients performed the tests both in “OFF” and\\n“ON” states. “OFF” states are those periods where rigidity, bradykinesia or postural alterations\\nappear in PD patients. During the “ON” state, these symptoms are mitigated due to medication\\neffect although other side effects may appear, such as dyskinesias. The inclusion criteria in this\\nclinical protocol were Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage [62] greater than 2 in the OFF state and the absence\\nof dementia according to DSM IV criteria [60]. In this work, which is focused on the detection\\nof FoG episodes, some additional inclusion criteria have been required. First, PD patients\\nshould have a FoG Questionnaire (FoG-Q) [15] score above 6, and only those PD patients\\nwhose total FoG duration was at least one minute long were selected. Overall, 21 patients out\\nof the 92 patients matched all inclusion criteria for this study (Table 3). The mean age was\\n69.29±9.72 years old and the mean Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage scoring was 3.07±0.43 in the OFF\\nstate. Sixteen patients needed walking assistance and the mean FoG-Q test index was 15.8\\n±4.11, the lowest score being 7 and the highest score 23. Six out of 21 patients did not exhibit\\ndyskinesias, and eleven patients had wearing-off phenomena. At time of the tests, all patients\\nwere medicated with optimal doses of levodopa and dopamine agonist therapy. Some baseline\\ndata from patient 5 were lost, which is shown as N/A in Table 3; however, they do not affect to\\nthe results of this study.\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n7 / 26\\nTable 2.

Although the proto-\\ncol test consisted of specific scripted activities, the test also allowed patients to perform several\\nactivities in a free moving manner. Furthermore, the activities were performed in a familiar\\nenvironment and the patient could proceed with their normal ADLs in a natural way. More\\nspecifically, the activities performed in both tests consisted of I) showing the researchers\\naround their home; II) Stand Up and Go test crossing through a doorway and then, turning\\nback (FoG provocation test), which was repeated up to 10 times; III) going outdoors and tak-\\ning a short walk; and IV) a dual task activity (e.g. reading while carrying an object). In the sec-\\nond test, i.e. following medication, a false positive protocol activity for FoG was additionally\\nperformed. This protocol test relies on performing different activities in which the patient exe-\\ncutes a short and fast movement repeatedly whose inertial frequency content is similar to a\\nFoG episode. The executed activities were brushing their teeth, painting/drawing/erasing on a\\nsheet of paper and cleaning windows.\\nA total of 93.03 minutes of FoG episodes were registered (1321 episodes) among these 21\\npatients, among which 74.12 minutes (79.67%) were registered when patients were in OFF\\nstate, 12.35 minutes (13.28%) were registered when patients were in ON state and 6.56 minutes\\n(7.05%) were registered in an intermediate state.\\nAcceleration signals were captured while patients executed the described protocol with the\\n9x2 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a small (77x37x21mm3) and light (78g with battery)\\nwearable inertial system (Fig 2) which was located at the left side of the waist [64]. This IMU,\\nwhose autonomy lasts more than a day, stored the accelerometer data at 200Hz in a microSD\\ncard.\\nAll tests were video-recorded and videos were synchronised with the signals recorded by\\nthe 9x2 device through a specific method [37]. In order to create a gold standard for the occur-\\nrence of FoG episodes, videos were labelled offline by an experienced clinician. Within the\\nMASPARK project [36], all activities, postures and partial FoG episodes were labelled by\\nclinicians.\\nPre-processing and feature extraction\\nThis subsection presents a description of the employed method for pre-processing the signal,\\nwhich comprises signal conditioning, windowing and feature extraction. Note that, since the\\nproposed algorithm is thought to be implemented in the near future within the 9x2 device for\\nits real-time execution, some computational issues have been taken into account to facilitate\\nthis future implementation. For example, windows with reduced amount of samples are con-\\nsidered in order to, first, reduce the latency time of the algorithm; second, to deal with the\\nFig 2.

This data\\nis resampled at 40Hz since this frequency has been shown to be enough to analyse human\\nmovements [65] and it is sufficient to analyse the frequencies obtained during FoG episodes\\n[20]. Once resampled, inertial signals are filtered in order to remove the high frequency noise\\nthrough a 2nd order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 15Hz cut-off frequency.\\nThe next step is to window the signal. According to Moore and colleagues, the specificity in\\nvery small window sizes is very low, thus, it is recommended to work with windows over 2.5 s\\n[27]. In other previous work, Ba¨chlin et al. worked in window sizes of 4s [29], Mazilu et al.\\nshowed how FoG detection performance was kept with windows over 3s [48] and Zach et al.\\nshowed that window lengths between 2 and 4 s. provided similar results [31]. In order to\\nachieve a similar window length and given that the sampling frequency is 40Hz, a window\\nlength of 128 samples (N = 128), i.e. 3.2s of window-length, is proposed. Windows are over-\\nlapped at 50% so as to prevent information loss between windows.\\nWith the aim to obtain significant information from each window, some features are\\nextracted. These features will be the input vector, xi, for the proposed classifier in Training pro-\\ncesses section, which is based on machine learning techniques. In this work, a total of 55 fea-\\ntures are employed, which are presented in Fig 3. Features are briefly described below by\\ngrouping them according to their purpose. The number of feature group is noted within\\nbrackets.\\nFig 3.

Integrals of the accelerometer axis gives information related to the quantity of movement.\\n12. Auto regression coefficients provide information of how the signal is correlated with a\\ntime-shifted version of itself giving the amount of time shift [69].\\nIn order to clarify some feature notation reported in Fig 3, see clarifications below.

Let jSW\\nh j ¼ jXW\\nh j þ jYW\\nh j þ jZW\\nh j be the summation of harmonics for each accelerometer\\naxis, where h = 0.1, . . .,8 Hz, so that a vector SW ¼ ½SW\\n1 ; . . . ; SW\\nN � is obtained, which represents\\nthe spectral information in the [0.1, 8] Hz band in a certain window. PCA has been used to\\nreduce the dimensionality of these harmonics. More specifically, PCA has been applied to a set\\nof SW vectors organised in a matrix M ¼ ½S1T S2T; . . . ; SLT�\\nT. These L windows are a randomly\\nselected subset of the training data composed by a 10% of the data from each patient, thus con-\\ntaining both FoG episodes and other signals. PCA is applied to in order to obtain the ortho-\\nnormal change of basis matrix V that brings each pattern SW from the original space to the\\nlatent one. PCA is applied to matrix M by first centring the data, and then applying a Singular\\nValue Decomposition (SVD) so that M = USV is obtained. In the SVD process, it was identi-\\nfied that only the first three latent variables contributed with data (i.e. their singular values\\nwere significantly higher than the rest). In consequence, only the first three components of the\\nlatent representation of SW, i.e. V SW, are employed as features (feature group 10). Note that\\nthe PCA process is only applied once in the training process and a real-time implementation\\nof the feature-extraction process would only require the implementation of the product V SW.\\nTraining processes\\nThe symptoms related to FoG episodes are user dependent with typical symptoms manifesting\\nas gait abnormalities (e.g. shuffling, leg trembling in place and akinetic episodes) [11]. As each\\nFoG patient experiences these symptoms in different ways, developing an algorithm to detect\\nFoG episodes from inertial signals can be challenging due to the variation between individual\\nsignals. To overcome these challenges previous researchers have developed user dependent\\nalgorithms capable of detecting FoG episodes with a high degree of accuracy [21,48]. These\\nalgorithms require the prior capturing of the patients inertial signals in order to train the algo-\\nrithm, thus making the algorithm cumbersome to obtain. A less challenging solution would be\\nto develop a generalised algorithm, since it would only require the obtaining of inertial signals\\nfrom a relatively small cohort of FoG patients in order to train the algorithm for use with any\\npatient. To investigate both types of algorithms and their associated training processes we pro-\\nposed two methodologies I) a generic model through a leave one out method and II) a model\\nthat is personalised to each patient.\\nGeneric FoG model selection.\\nIn order to obtain a generic (user independent) model, a\\nleave-one-patient-out methodology has been adopted. The model is generic in the sense that it\\nis not personalised to any patient and there is no adjustment made to the model that considers\\nthe patient for which the model is tested on. Given the nature of the problem at hand, Support\\nVector Machines (SVM) have been considered to be the most suitable classifier, due to their\\nhigh performance method for two-class classification and ease of implementation within\\nmicrocontrollers [70]. SVM is a machine learning technique that use the kernel trick to map\\ninput vectors (xi 2 &lt;N; 1 � i � p) to a higher dimensional feature space by φ(xi), where typi-\\ncally φ : &lt;n ! &lt;m and subjected by m &gt; n. The kernel trick enables SVM to avoid bringing xi\\nto the higher dimensional space by computing the dot product of patterns within &lt;n.\\nIn our approach, each xi is represented by 55 parameters (previously described in the Pre-\\nprocessing and feature extraction section) which characterise the current window W. The input\\nvectors are associated to one of two different classes, FoG or no-FoG. These classes are repre-\\nsented by the labels yi = {1, −1}, 1 � i � p, where yi = 1 in case of a FoG pattern and yi = -1 in\\ncase of a non-FoG pattern. The set of yi values is provided by clinical experts with the help of\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n13 / 26\\nvideo recordings that were synchronised with their associated inertial signals. In order to max-\\nimise the margin, reduce the empirical error and minimise the structural risk, a hyperplane is\\nbuilt to separate the 2 classes [71]. The optimal hyperplane is defined according to the follow-\\ning optimisation problem:\\nminimize WðaÞ ¼\\nXp\\ni¼1ai � 1\\n2\\nXp\\ni;j¼1 aiajyiyj � Kðxi; xjÞ\\n�\\n�\\nð2Þ\\ns: t\\n0 � ai � C;\\ni ¼ 1; . . . ; p\\nin which C is the trade-off between the classification margin and misclassification error, and\\nthe kernel function K(xi, xj) replaces the dot product φ(xi)�φ(xj). The kernel used for the FoG\\nclassifier is a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF), due to its good performance and generalisa-\\ntion capacity, Kðxi; xjÞ ¼ e�gkxi�xjk2, where γ is the width of RBF function.\\nDue to the leave-one-patient-out approach, these parameters must be adjusted with the\\ndata from all patients except one. Thus, with this data, a range of values {10−2, 10−1, . . ., 102}\\nfor C and γ are tested through a 10-fold cross-validation method. From the results of the differ-\\nent folds the average sensitivity and specificity is obtained for each combination of values.\\nOptimal parameters for the SVM (Copt, γopt) are those that maximise the following expression:\\nðCopt; goptÞ ¼ argmaxð\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nSensitivityC;g � SpecificityC;g\\nq\\nÞ\\nð3Þ\\ns: t: SensitivityC;g &gt; 70%; SpecificityC;g &gt; 70%\\nOnce found, the optimal values are used to train the SVM model. The data from the patient\\nthat is still unused is then employed to test the model with a specific procedure, which is\\ndescribed in the Evaluation of the proposed algorithm section. The entire training process is\\nrepeated by keeping apart the data from each patient; in consequence, the number of SVM\\nmodels obtained is the same as the number of available patients.\\nPersonalised FoG model selection.\\nIn this section, the proposed user-dependent method\\nis described. In order to obtain a user-dependent model, a modified leave-one-patient-out\\nmethod has been adopted, which also has been performed by means of SVM. In contrast to the\\ngeneric model presented in the previous subsection, the personalised model requires labelled\\ninertial signal data from the user in order to obtain the personalised classifier before using it in\\nreal life. Therefore, we will use a portion of the data from the patient being tested to train our\\nclassifier, and the remaining portion of data will be used to evaluate the algorithm. Signals\\nfrom the patient being tested are divided into two sets, the first set being composed of 50% of\\nthe labelled FoG episodes with the corresponding non-episodic signals, and the second set\\ncomprising the remaining FoG episodes and non-episodic windows. Only the first set, i.e. the\\nfirst half, is included in the training dataset, as shown in Fig 4. We note that the optimal choice\\nof the training data would be to include 50% of the signals into the training dataset (without\\nsplitting by episodes) and the remaining 50% into the evaluation dataset. However, there are\\npatients who mostly freeze during the initial data collection while other patients only presented\\nFoG during the second part of the data collection. Therefore, the number of episodes in each\\ndataset would be, in most cases, unbalanced. Hence, the training dataset is chosen to be those\\nparts of the signal from the testing patient that comprise 50% of the FoG episodes, together\\nwith the non-episodic signals, as shown in Fig 4. Due to these requirements and the evaluation\\nprocess, episodes cannot be selected randomly. If FoG episodes were selected randomly, those\\nparts of the signal that do not contain FoG episodes would have to be randomly selected as\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n14 / 26\\nwell. Consequently, the proposed evaluation method would not be valid, since, as shown in the\\nnext Section, True Positives (TP) and False Negatives (FN) depend on episode durations, and\\nTrue Negatives (TN) and False Positives (FP) depend on the amount of detected time spent\\nwithout a positive detection. Thus, random episode selection would make detection’s temporal\\nline disappear and evaluation by episode would be unfeasible.\\nLikewise, the same analysis is performed again but swapping the training and evaluation\\ndatasets of the testing patient employed to train and to validate the model. In consequence,\\nafter first training the model with data from non-testing patients and the first set of the data\\nfrom the testing patient, a second training takes place. In this case, the second set comprising\\nof the last 50% of the episodes, including non-episodic signals, of the testing patient are\\nincluded into the training dataset as shown in the lower part of Fig 4. The first 50% of the epi-\\nsodes and its corresponding non-episodic signals are then employed for evaluating the\\nobtained model. Although other percentages of training/evaluation could be tested, in this\\ncase, the authors consider that the 50% of FoG episodes’ data contains enough information of\\nnon-episodic signals as well.\\nIn this modified leave-one-out approach, data from the non-testing 20 patients represent a\\nclearly greater dataset compared to data from the patient being tested; thus, data from the latter\\nare almost negligible and they would not have any impact in the training process. Hence, it is\\nconsidered interesting to force the model selection process to learn from the testing patient’s\\ndata with more influence than the remaining patients. More specifically, the weight of the test-\\ning patient’s data is set to be the same as the data from the other 20 patients.

On the other hand, the weight\\ngiven to those patterns from the training dataset belonging to the 20-patients’ data is\\nw20 ¼\\nnf\\nn20þnf. Accordingly, for the second half, ns would be used instead of nf. Thus, the weight\\ngiven to each part corresponds to the prior of the alternative part of the training dataset. These\\nFig 4.

Afterwards, the methodology for obtaining the\\nSVM model will be repeated switching the parts used in the training and evaluation. Thus, the\\nmodel is prevented from overfitting as only one part of the data is performed by the patient,\\nwhich may coincide with a specific test and not with ADL. Finally, to ensure each patient’s\\ndata is used once as a testing patient the process is completed 21 times.\\nEvaluation of the proposed algorithm\\nTo analysis, the performance of each methodology, a rigorous evaluation is performed which\\nfollows the methodology previously described [72]. Due to likely situations in which patients\\nare sitting, standing, or lying for long periods of time the proportion of TN (conditions in\\nwhich a FoG episode was not detected by the algorithm and the patient was not in a FoG epi-\\nsode) becomes extremely large. Similarly, due to situations in which patients experience long\\nFoG episodes the proportion of TP (conditions in which a FoG episode was detected by the\\nalgorithm and the patient was in a FoG episode) also becomes extremely large. The purposed\\nevaluation process aims to balance the excessive number of TN and TP that may appear with\\nwindow-based evaluations of machine learning approaches through the evaluation analysis of\\nepisodes instead of the evaluation analysis of windows that contain an episode. Therefore, a\\nFoG episode is evaluated from its beginning until its end as a single episode, instead of being\\nevaluated within every window that contains the FoG episode.\\nGiven that during the data collection protocol the minimum time taken by patients to per-\\nform the false positive test was 38s, it was considered that the maximum time of a single TN\\nepisode should be 30 seconds. Thus, for example, if a patient is executing some activity without\\nany FoG episode during 40 seconds, 2 TN are considered. Additionally, a TN episode is only a\\nconsideration if the TN episode is longer than 5 seconds as the average duration of a FoG epi-\\nsode in the collected data was 5.14 seconds (Fig 5). Furthermore, TP, FN, and FP are evaluated\\nfrom Fig 5 as:\\n• A single TP is considered if a FoG episode was detected by the algorithm and the patient was\\nclinically labelled as having a FoG episode.\\n• A single FP is considered if a FoG episode was detected by the algorithm and the patient was\\nclinically labelled as not having a FoG episode.\\n• A single FN is considered if a FoG episode was not detected by the algorithm and the patient\\nwas clinically labelled as having a FoG episode.\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n16 / 26\\nMBFA method assessment\\nTo further analyse the performance of each methodology, a comparison to the most widely\\nused technique of FoG detection is made. Given that the MBFA has been shown to provide\\ngood performance (&gt;80% in sensitivity and specificity in a non-user dependent algorithm\\n[27]) and, in addition, the MBFA has been widely used by many authors for detecting FoG\\n[22–24,26,27,31,46–50], the authors consider the MBFA as an accurate baseline method for\\ncomparison purposes. Similarly, to our proposed approach, a user-independent (leave-one-\\npatient-out) evaluation has been designed for the MBFA method and compared with the pro-\\nposed user-independent method described in the Generic FoG Model Selection section.\\nThe main parameters to be adjusted within the MBFA method are PTH and FTH. Thus, a\\nrange of values for each parameter has been tested for each patient, consisting in values\\n[0,0.5, . . .,4]. After evaluation each pair of PTH and FTH values provide a certain number of\\nTP, TN, FN and FP that are represented in terms of sensitivity\\nSensitivity ¼\\nTP\\nTPþFN\\n�\\n�\\nand speci-\\nficity\\nSpecificity ¼\\nTN\\nTNþFP\\n�\\n�\\n. These values are used to evaluate the MBFA algorithm as described\\nin the Evaluation of the proposed algorithm section. Thus, let EvalkðPTH; FTHÞ : &lt;2 ! &lt;4 be a\\nfunction which returns the number of TP, FP, TN, FN of a given signal from patient k. From\\nthese values, the sensitivity and specificity of the parameters in detecting FoG episodes are\\nobtained based on the previous formulas, which is represented by Sens (Evalk (PTH, FTH))\\nand Spec (Evalk (PTH, FTH)). Given that a leave-one-patient-out method is employed, a sum-\\nmation for all Evalk (PTH, FTH) belonging to all non-testing patients is performed following\\nEq (5):\\nLOOtðFTH; PTHÞ ¼\\nXk6¼t\\nk¼1;...;21EvalkðFTH; PTHÞ\\nð5Þ\\nThe optimal values for PTH and FTH are obtained according to Eq (6) and by using the\\ndata from the training dataset.

To put the results into perspective, the SVM and the MBFA results are shown\\ntogether. Both SVM and the MBFA methods of FoG detection have been evaluated on a\\ngeneric model and a personalised model basis. Table 4 presents the specificity, sensitivity and\\ntheir geometric mean averaged among the 21 PD patients for both methods and both models.\\nTable 4.

The resulting increase of 8.4% obtained for the MBFA is consistent with\\nthe results reported in [21]. Similarly, the SVM method shows better results by considering the\\ndata from the patient being tested, which is an interesting finding that has not been previously\\nreported and that can help to obtain enhanced models for FoG detection.\\nRegarding the performance of the MBFA and the SVM method, it can be seen that the\\nSVM methods geometric mean is significantly greater than the MBFA methods geometric\\nmean. Specifically, the proposed method outperforms the MBFA method with an increase of\\n11.2% for the generic model and an increase of 10% for the personalised model. Thus, the\\ndetection of FoG episodes are significantly improved using the SVM method in comparison to\\nthe MBFA method. In fact, the machine learning approach better generalises the problem in\\nall the results obtained. This is due to the inclusion of several features that characterise in a\\nmore accurate way not only the FoG episodes but also those parts with possible FP, thus pro-\\nviding a much higher specificity. In this sense, it is notable that the specificity of the MBFA\\ngeneric model is 52.6%, while the corresponding SVM-based specificity is 79%.\\nTable 5 presents the individual patient results obtained by the SVM method for both the\\ngeneric and the personalised models. These results aim to show how the personalisation model\\nimproves the detection of FoG episodes in comparison to the generic model. For example, the\\ngeometric mean for patient 1 is only 37.35% for the generic model and 86.2% for the personali-\\nsation model. In total, for 16 patients the personalisation provides an increase in the geometric\\nmean which corresponds to a greater detection of FoG episodes. However, in the remaining 5\\npatients (number 4, 10, 11, 12 and 18), the geometric mean is slightly lower, below 3%. This\\nmay occur when the scenario in the first half of the test is different to the second part and,\\nthus, episodes may appear differently. Most patients freeze similarly during the whole test but,\\nhowever, there are patients who freeze in a different manner inside their homes than outside.\\nTrained models can learn that, in the main, episodes occur in a stereotypical way. When the\\nevaluation is performed outdoors or in a different scenario in the other half of the test the clas-\\nsifier might not work properly and thus the mean could decrease a little compared to the\\ngeneric SVM.\\nSome previous papers have reported results of sensitivity and specificity over 90%, which\\nare higher than those shown in this paper. However, some issues are evident in those works\\n[28,48,52].\\nThe evaluation method consists of a leave one window out, which actually trains the model\\nwith all the windows (including the testing patient) except for one. Therefore, the testing sig-\\nnals are very similar to the trained signals, resulting in very high accuracies. In addition, the\\nleaving one window out approach considers each window either as a positive or a negative\\ncase, which overestimates specificity and sensitivity values, as presented in the previous sec-\\ntions. In the majority of the papers, results have been obtained by considering either laboratory\\nconditions or the use of multiple sensors, which increases the accuracy of FoG detection.\\nIn this work, a more reliable evaluation method has been employed, which consists in eval-\\nuating through the leave one patient out method. Using this method, at least half of the signals\\nfrom the testing patient (for the personalised model) has been omitted in order to properly test\\nthe model. Additionally, our results have been obtained in the patients’ own home and by\\nusing a single sensor located on the waist. The waist location has been shown to be comfortable\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n19 / 26\\nfor users [32] but, in contrast, the detection of FoG accuracy is not as accurate as that obtained\\nby setting the inertial systems on the feet [21]. In consequence, the additional difficulty pro-\\nvided through these conditions also explain the lower results obtained.\\nWith a specificity of 61% and sensitivity values of approximately 50% on average, it is evi-\\ndent that the evaluation of MBFA is reduced due to the new evaluation methodology. In\\naddition, the effect of performing the dataset in patient’s home environments and while per-\\nforming some false positive tests, suggests the MBFA may not be very reliable in a home\\nenvironment.\\nThe proposed evaluation method assesses the algorithm for FoG detection in relation to the\\nnumber of episodes, by balancing the number of TN, TP, FN and FP. However, this method is\\nnot able to determine the length of each episode. Given that the processing method is per-\\nformed through windows, the resolution of the episode can only be 1.6 seconds and the mini-\\nmum FoG episode time is 3.2 seconds according to the specifications reported in the Pre-\\nProcessing and feature extraction section.\\nSo far, the MBFA model has been seen as an optimal model due to its low computational\\ncost and good performance. Compared to our model, the computational burden is signifi-\\ncantly lower; nonetheless, the accuracies obtained are also lower. However, with recent techno-\\nlogical advances, the inclusion of virtual digital signal processors within the microcontrollers\\nand the relevant growth of performance with low power consumption makes it feasible to\\nimplement real-time machine learning classifiers with several support vectors and wide feature\\nvectors. In spite of this, the authors considered that the models obtained by the proposed\\napproach should be optimised in the future before being implemented in real time. The model\\nTable 5.

Regarding the online optimisation,\\nthe non-user dependent model presented employs an average of 6790±387 support vectors\\namong the different leave-one-out models. Considering 4 bytes for each floating point num-\\nber, an average of 1494KB of memory is required in order to store the SVM model. On the\\nother hand, the user dependent model uses 9221±520 support vectors requiring 2028KB.\\nThese models may require a considerable portion of the memory available on some low to\\nmoderate power consumption and high-performance microcontroller such as Cortex-M4\\nARM microcontrollers. Thus, a reduction of support vectors may be done, for instance, by\\nmeans of Separable Case Approximation method [73]. Using this method, the non-user\\ndependent model is reduced from 7147 support vectors to 4598, reducing the amount of mem-\\nory needed by 30%. Although the proposed algorithm has been developed to be implemented\\nonline within a microcontroller, and there are low power high-performance microcontrollers\\nthat could support the required 1011KB (corresponding memory for 4598 support vectors), a\\nreduction of features should be done, together with further removal of support vectors, in\\norder to minimise the computational burden on the prediction phase. However, this may\\nreduce performance of the algorithm, thus, the trade-off between performance and computa-\\ntional burden, which directly affects the microcontroller capacity and increases its consump-\\ntion has to be considered.\\nConclusions\\nThe MBFA is a method to detect FoG episodes with the analysis of frequency features obtained\\nby an accelerometer signal of a wearable system. This method has been used in numerous\\nstudies [22–24,26,27,31,46–50] due to its simplicity (just the optimisation of 2 features) and its\\nhigh accuracy in detecting FoG episodes (&gt;80%, according to Moore et al. [27]). However, the\\nmethod has only been tested under laboratory conditions without taking into account situa-\\ntions which could lead to false positives. As far as the authors know, the evaluation method\\ndoes not consider those situations where long periods of negative outputs such as sitting, lying,\\nor standing, overstate the specificity results.\\nThis paper presents a supervised machine learning approach to detect FoG that has been\\ntrained and evaluated with an inertial dataset obtained from an IMU located at patients’ waist\\nwhile the PD patients were at home [37]. Two methodologies have been proposed and evalu-\\nated based on the leave one out method. On the one hand, a generic model that is not adjusted\\nto any patient has been proposed, and, on the other hand, a personalised model, which is\\ntrained with part of the inertial signal from the patient undergoing testing. Both generic and\\npersonalised model selection approaches have been assessed with the MBFA and the proposed\\nmachine learning method. Furthermore, an optimisation method to select the MBFA model\\nhas been employed. The evaluation has been performed by balancing the number of true posi-\\ntives and true negatives and also evaluating episode instead of the window, leading to a more\\nreliable assessment. For the personalised model, only the 50% of the FoG episodes including\\nthose non-episodic signals have been used for training, enabling the rest of the signals to be\\nused for evaluation. This percentage has been selected given that some patients have a low\\nnumber of FoG episodes, this way, the evaluation set is larger. Furthermore, validation of\\nresults is more significant if evaluation percentage is larger since the classifier avoids overfit-\\nting, reinforcing, thus, the performance of the model.\\nOur results show how the personalised models outperform the generic models by on aver-\\nage by 10%. However, and as stated in the Personalised FoG model selection section, it requires\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n21 / 26\\na data capture and data training process, which is not necessary with the non-user dependent\\nmodel. This process involves taking data from patients with video recording to capture differ-\\nent FoG episodes at the patients’ home with a specific protocol test to elicit FoG episodes. This\\nmethod of data collection can be cumbersome to obtain for the patient.\\nOn the other hand, the machine learning approach enhances significantly the results\\nobtained with the MBFA model. Evaluations per episode show that the machine learning\\napproach either increases both sensitivity and specificity or may only increase one, leave the\\nother unchanged. The geometric mean of both sensitivity and specificity and their average\\nhave been used to compare both models (MBFA and SVM). SVM enhances these values by 8%\\nand 11%, respectively. Improvements might be explained by 2 factors. Firstly, the capacity of\\ngeneralisation of a machine learning method in comparison to the 2 thresholds based MBFA\\nmethod. Secondly, is the inclusion of several features, which better characterise the episodes\\nand the non-episodic movements. Since the database was constructed from data collected in\\nreal environments, situations that are more reflective of real conditions could be used in order\\nto strengthen the classifier against false positives, achieving much better specificities. However,\\nthe algorithm needs some optimisation in order to be implemented in a microcontroller of a\\nwearable device for real-time applications. The most relevant issue is the number of support\\nvectors, which should be reduced as shown in the Evaluation of the proposed algorithm section.\\nThis reduction would lower the computational burden.\\nResults obtained provide a sensitivity and specificity geometric mean of 84% in the person-\\nalised model and of 76% in the generic model, which are significant enough to evaluate FoG at\\npatients’ home. These results have been obtained under challenging conditions, at patients’\\nhome and with a rigorous evaluation process in order to balance the number of true positives\\nand true negatives.\\nAs far as authors know, this algorithm is the first to achieve high sensitivities and specifici-\\nties considering an online implementation using a balanced assessment per episode through\\npatients’ home training, which included a false positive test. This algorithm opens up the possi-\\nbility to rigorously assess FoG in PD patients in real time with the aim of acting quickly with\\nsome cueing modalities [8,74]. Additionally, given that medication considerably affects FoG\\nfrequency and severity in some patients [63], this algorithm could help to accurately tailor\\nmedication regimes in future.\\nAcknowledgments\\nPart of this project has been performed within the framework of the MASPARK project which\\nis funded by La Fundacio´ La Marato´ de TV3 20140431.

We investigated fully automatic coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring and\\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) risk categorization from CT attenuation correction (CTAC)\\nacquired at rest and stress during cardiac PET/CT and compared it with manual annotations in\\nCTAC and with dedicated calcium scoring CT (CSCT).\\nMethods and Results. We included 133 consecutive patients undergoing myocardial per-\\nfusion 82Rb PET/CT with the acquisition of low-dose CTAC at rest and stress. Additionally, a\\ndedicated CSCT was performed for all patients. Manual CAC annotations in CTAC and CSCT\\nprovided the reference standard. In CTAC, CAC was scored automatically using a previously\\ndeveloped machine learning algorithm. Patients were assigned to a CVD risk category based on\\ntheir Agatston score (0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, &gt;400). Agreement in CVD risk categorization\\nbetween manual and automatic scoring in CTAC at rest and stress resulted in Cohen’s linearly\\nweighted j of 0.85 and 0.89, respectively. The agreement between CSCT and CTAC at rest\\nresulted in j of 0.82 and 0.74, using manual and automatic scoring, respectively. For CTAC at\\nstress, these were 0.79 and 0.70, respectively.\\nConclusion. Automatic CAC scoring from CTAC PET/CT may allow routine CVD risk\\nassessment from the CTAC component of PET/CT without any additional radiation dose or\\nscan time.

This article is an open access\\npublication\\n2133\\nINTRODUCTION\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) myocardial per-\\nfusion imaging (MPI) is a well-established noninvasive\\nprocedure for evaluation of hemodynamically signiﬁcant\\ncoronary artery disease (CAD). However, PET is not able to\\nvisualize atherosclerotic plaque, and hence, it does not allow\\ndetection of subclinical CAD.1 The coronary artery calcium\\n(CAC) burden determined in calcium scoring CT (CSCT),\\nquantiﬁed as the CAC score, is a strong and independent\\npredictor of cardiovascular events (CVE)2 and adds prog-\\nnostic and diagnostic information to an MPI scan.1 Previous\\nstudies suggest that CT attenuation correction (CTAC)\\nimages that are acquired as a part of PET/CT or SPECT/CT\\nmay potentially enable the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\\nof atherosclerotic calciﬁcations in the coronary arteries, and\\nthereby allow improved assessment of CVE risk.3,4 If the\\nCTAC component of the cardiac MPI could be used for\\ncalcium scoring and thereby for the improved evaluation of\\nCVE risk and improved diagnosis,1 the acquisition of a\\ndedicated CSCT scan could be omitted, reducing ionizing\\nradiation dose for the patients, shorteningthe studytime,and\\nsimplifying the procedure. However, CTAC images are not\\nacquired using an optimized protocol for calcium scoring.\\nExcessive motion artifacts, low image resolution, and high\\nlevels of image noise make manual calcium scoring in\\nCTAC a tedious task. Hence, an automatic method would be\\nadvantageous in clinical routine. In this work, we investigate\\nthe utility of a novel method for fully automatic calcium\\nscoring applied to CTAC images. The method is speciﬁcally\\noptimized to score CAC in rest and stress CTAC images that\\nare acquired as part of cardiac PET/CT MPI exams.\\nAdditionally, we compare cardiovascular (CVD) risk cate-\\ngorization obtained from dedicated CSCT scans with\\nmanual and automatic CAC scoring in CTAC images.\\nMETHODS\\nPatients\\nThe study included consecutive 133 patients (85 men, 48\\nwomen, average age 69, age range 31-97) undergoing 82Rb\\nPET/CT and dedicated CSCT scanning at Cedars-Sinai Med-\\nical Center. Table 1 lists patients’ demographic and clinical\\ndata. All patients provided written informed consent for the use\\nof their clinical and imaging data for research purposes, and\\nthe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.\\nImaging Protocols\\nPET. All patients underwent rest and stress gated 82Rb\\nPET MPI and CSCT imaging on a hybrid Biograph 64 PET/CT\\nscanner.5 A 6-minute rest acquisition started immediately before\\nthe injection of 925-1850 MBq (25-50 mCi) of 82Rb. Pharma-\\ncological stress was induced using intravenous adenosine\\ninfusion6 or using a regadenoson bolus.7 No adjunctive exercise\\nwas performed. A 6-minute stress acquisition started immedi-\\nately with the injection of 925-1850 MBq (25-50 mCi) of 82Rb.\\nCTAC. Separate CTAC scans were acquired immedi-\\nately after stress and rest emission PET studies, without\\nmoving the patient from the scan table. The CTAC parameters\\nwere 100 kVp, pitch 1.5, 11 mAs, duration 3.4 seconds, 3 mm\\nslice thickness, end-expiration breath hold.\\nCSCT. After completion of PET MPI, without moving\\npatients from the scan table, CSCT scan was acquired. CSCT\\nscans (120 kVp, 11 mAs, 3 mm slice thickness and increment,\\nECG-triggering) consisted of 30 to 40 slices encompassing the\\nheart from the carina to the apex, with a 30-35 cm ﬁeld of view\\nsufﬁcient to include the entire heart as well as the ascending\\nand descending thoracic aortas.\\nManual Calcium Scoring\\nIn CSCT scans, CAC scoring was performed as part of\\nclinical routine using dedicated CT vendor software (SciI-\\nmage, California US). This software applies a standard 130\\nHounsﬁeld unit (HU) threshold for calciﬁcation extraction. For\\neach patient, the Agatston score was computed. Subjects were\\nassigned to a CVD risk category based on the Agatston score\\n(0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, [400).8,9\\nIn CTAC scans, CAC scoring was performed by an\\nexperienced observer using dedicated in-house developed\\nsoftware9 using a standard 130 HU threshold. To minimize\\nthe effect of intraobserver variability, CTAC scans of each\\npatient acquired at rest and stress were scored consecutively.\\nThe observer was blinded to CAC annotations in CSCT scans.\\nIn CTAC scans, number of lesions, Agatston, and volume\\ncalcium scores were computed.10\\nAutomatic Calcium Scoring from\\nAttenuation Maps\\nCoronary calciﬁcations were identiﬁed using our previ-\\nously developed algorithm for automatic CAC scoring from\\nTable 1.

Given that CTAC scans are obtained for attenuation\\ncorrection and are made using suboptimal image acquisition\\nsettings for calcium scoring, scans are affected by substantial\\nimage noise, artifacts caused by cardiac motion due to lack of\\nECG synchronization, and partial volume effect caused by the\\nlarge in-plane resolution. Hence, for this work, the algorithm\\nwas speciﬁcally optimized for CTAC images.\\nThe algorithm ﬁrst identiﬁes potential CAC lesions in the\\nimage by intensity-based thresholding and 3D connected-\\ncomponent labeling, thus following the standard clinical\\nprocedure. Single voxel lesions are removed from further\\nanalysis as they cannot be differentiated from the noise.\\nSubsequently, each potential calciﬁed lesion is characterized\\nby a number of features, such as volume, shape, intensity and\\nlocation. Shape features are calculated as ratios of eigenvalues\\nfound using a principal component analysis on the location of\\nthe voxels within each candidate. Intensity features are\\ncomputed using the intensity value statistics of each lesion\\nand Gaussian ﬁlters at different resolutions. Location features\\ndescribe the spatial position of each candidate using an\\nestimate of the location of the coronary artery tree, which is\\nacquired using multi-atlas based segmentation. Once features\\nfor all potential CAC lesions have been computed, a two-class\\nclassiﬁer separates CAC and negative lesions such as calciﬁ-\\ncations in the aorta, bones, or noise. The classiﬁer consists of\\nan ensemble of 250 extremely randomized decision trees\\n(Extra-Trees).9,12\\nTenfold cross-validation experiments were performed by\\ndividing the CTAC data into training sets containing 90% of\\nthe images and test sets containing the remaining 10% of\\nimages. Tenfold cross-validation allows strict per patient\\nseparation of training and test data and maximizes the amount\\nof training data. For each candidate lesion, the algorithm\\ndetermined the probability that it was CAC and labeled it as\\neither CAC or background. The identiﬁed CAC was quantiﬁed\\nusing the same procedure as in manual scoring.\\nValidation\\nTo evaluate whether automatic CAC scoring applied to\\nCTAC images is feasible, the CAC scores obtained manually\\nand automatically were compared. This analysis was per-\\nformed separately for CTAC images acquired during rest and\\nstress.\\nTo evaluate whether CAC scoring in CSCT images could\\nbe substituted by CAC scoring in CTAC scans, manual and\\nautomatic CAC scores determined in CTAC images were\\ncompared with CAC scores determined in CSCT scans.\\nStatistical Analysis\\nTo evaluate the performance of automatic CAC scoring in\\nCTAC scans, per patient sensitivity and a number of false\\npositives using the number of lesions and their volume were\\ndetermined. The reliability of the Agatston scores was\\ndetermined by the two-way mixed intraclass correlation\\ncoefﬁcient (ICC) for absolute agreement between manual\\nand automatic scores in CTAC images. In addition, we\\ncompared CAC scores in CSCT with manual and automatic\\nCAC scores in CTAC images. The analyses were performed\\nseparately for CTAC scans acquired at rest and stress.\\nFurthermore, we evaluated whether there was a difference\\nbetween Agatston scores derived from CTAC images acquired\\nat rest and at stress, with either manual or automatic scoring,\\nby Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Bonferroni correction was\\napplied to correct for multiple pairwise comparisons, so that\\nthe level of signiﬁcance was set to 0.0083.\\nTo evaluate accuracy and agreement of CVD risk\\ncategorization between automatic and manual CAC scoring\\nin CTAC scans, patients were assigned to one of the standard\\nﬁve CVD risk categories (0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, [400).8 It\\nis likely that for patients scanned with two different CT\\nsettings, obtained CAC scores may differ but the ranking of the\\npatient scores remains the same. Therefore, we compared CVD\\nrisk categorization between CTAC and CSCT images by ﬁrst\\ndetermining the number of patients assigned to each CVD risk\\ngroup according to the Agatston scores in CSCT scans.\\nSubsequently, the Agatston scores obtained in CTAC scans\\nwere ranked, and we assigned the same number of patients to\\neach group as determined by their ranking with respect to the\\nCSCT categorization.13 The analysis was performed separately\\nfor CTAC scans at rest and stress, and separately for manual\\nand automatic scoring in these images.\\nThe accuracy of CVD risk categorization was determined\\nas a percentage of scans in which two methods agree. The\\nproportion of agreement beyond chance between CVD risk\\ncategory assignments was determined using Cohen’s linearly\\nweighted j. Comparisons between kappa values and accuracies\\nwere performed by Z-score test. Statistical analysis was\\nperformed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 23. Armonk,\\nNY: IBM Corp.). Cohen’s j was computed using VassarStats\\nanalysis (http://vassarstats.net/kappa.html).\\nRESULTS\\nAutomatic vs Manual Calcium Scoring in\\nCTAC Scans\\nFive patients were excluded due to high levels of\\nimage noise4 and artifacts caused by metal implants1\\npreventing manual CAC scoring.\\nIn\\nrest\\nCTAC\\nscans,\\nthe\\nalgorithm\\ncorrectly\\ndetected 68.5% CAC lesions and 76.4% CAC volume\\nper scan, with on average 0.3 false positive lesions\\ncorresponding to 25 mm3 false positive volume per\\nscan.

Nevertheless, inspection\\nof the automatic results in CTAC scans revealed several\\noutliers. The automatic method occasionally missed\\nlarge CAC lesions affected by cardiac motion or partial\\nvolume effect resulting in low contrast with the sur-\\nrounding tissue (Figure 3a). This led to underestimation\\nof the CVD risk. Similarly, the automatic method\\noccasionally incorrectly detected noise voxels or calci-\\nﬁcations in the aorta at the coronary ostia, leading to\\noverestimation of the CVD risk (Figure 3b). False\\nnegative lesions were often larger than false positives,\\nleading to more frequent under- than overestimation of\\nthe CAC burden and consequently of the CVD risk\\ncategory (14% vs 3% at rest; 9% vs 3% at stress).

There was a signiﬁcant difference between Agatston\\nscores in CSCT and Agatston scores in CTAC (P � .01).\\nThis was the case for CTAC scans acquired at rest and\\nstress as well as for automatic and manual CAC scoring.\\nHowever, there was no signiﬁcant difference between\\nmanual Agatston scores in CTAC at rest and CTAC at\\nstress (P = .678), nor between automatic Agatston scores\\nin CTAC at rest and CTAC at stress (P = .281).\\nAgreements in CVD risk categorization between\\nmanual expert scoring in dedicated CSCT scans with\\nmanual and automatic scoring in CTAC scans during\\nrest and during stress are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The\\ncorresponding accuracies and linearly weighted j values\\nare listed in Table 5, indicating good to excellent\\nagreement of both manual and automatic scoring.\\nEven though results demonstrate that manual expert\\nCAC scoring in CTAC tends to slightly better agree with\\nexpert scoring in CSCT than automatic CAC scoring in\\nCTAC scans, visual inspection of the images suggests\\nthat differences in image characteristics between CSCT\\nand CTAC scans have a stronger inﬂuence on the CAC\\nscores than false positive and false negative errors made\\nby the automatic algorithm. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate\\ndifferences between the image characteristics and their\\nimpact on the visualization of CAC lesions.\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis study evaluated both manual and automatic\\ncoronary calcium scoring in CTAC images acquired\\nduring PET/CT scanning. In addition, the obtained CAC\\nscores in CTAC images were compared with manual\\nexpert CAC scores in CSCT scans to evaluate the\\npotential of CAC scoring in CTAC images and thereby\\nassess the possibility of using CTAC maps alone for\\ncardiac risk assessment. A comparison of manual and\\nautomatic CAC scoring in CTAC images showed that\\nthe vast majority ([83%) of patients could be assigned\\nto the correct CVD risk category based on automatic risk\\nassessment.\\nCompared with manual CAC scores in CTAC\\nimages, automatic scoring in images at stress tends to\\nresult in slightly better performance than automatic\\nscoring in images at rest (ICC: 0.884 and 0.828, and j\\n0.89 and 0.85 in stress and rest, respectively). Visual\\ninspection of the images did not reveal obvious causes.\\nHowever, it appeared that errors were similar in both\\nscans suggesting that combining the automatic results\\nfrom both images would not lead to a better agreement\\nbetween the scores in CTAC and CSCT scans. Note that\\nthere was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between\\nthe manual CAC scores in CTAC at rest and at stress,\\nnor between the automatic CAC scores in CTAC at rest\\nand stress.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, very few studies have\\ninvestigated quantitative CAC scoring from standard\\nCTAC scans obtained in PET or SPECT3,4,14. In a\\nmulticenter study including 492 patients, Einstein et al.3\\nFigure 2.

In comparison with a study\\nby Einstein et al., we evaluated the CAC scoring\\nseparately for rest and stress CTAC scans and also\\nevaluated the performance of the automated method. In\\ntwo other recent studies, Mylonas et al.4 and Kaster\\net al.14 scored calcium using the manual identiﬁcation of\\ncoronary calciﬁcations, while we evaluated fully auto-\\nmatic quantiﬁcation in CTAC scans. On a set of 91\\npatients, Mylonas et al.4 reported an ICC of 0.804\\nbetween manually obtained Agatston scores in CSCT\\nand CTAC during rest using a 130 HU threshold for\\nCAC scoring. In the current study, in a set of 128\\npatients, this agreement was 0.863 and 0.866 for rest and\\nstress, respectively. This difference might have been\\nFigure 3.

First, in our study, CTAC and\\nCSCT scans were made on the same day, without\\nmoving the patient off the table, while in Mylonas et al.4\\nthe scans were acquired within 6 months’ time interval.\\nEven though changes in calcium burden within this\\nperiod are unlikely, they might have occurred. However,\\nit is more likely that interscan variability, additionally\\ncaused by different patient positioning on the table,\\nmight have had a larger inﬂuence on the CAC scores.\\nSecond, Mylonas et al.4 evaluated agreement between\\nmanual scoring in CTAC images vs CSCT using\\ndifferent threshold levels and obtained best results using\\nan intensity value threshold of 50 HU with ICC of 0.953.\\nMoreover, Kaster et al.14 reported the best agreement\\nusing an 110 HU threshold. However, in the set of\\nimages used in our study, CAC scoring using an 110 and\\n50 HU threshold level did not allow separation of\\ncalciﬁcations from the background. Using such low\\nthresholds frequently connected CAC lesions with bony\\nstructures. The standard intensity value threshold of 130\\nHU seemed to agree best with the visual assessment of\\ncoronary artery calciﬁcations in our images.

In dedicated CSCT scans, ﬁve (Agat-\\nston scores 0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, [400)8 or four\\n(Agatston scores 0, 1-100, 101-300, [300) risk cate-\\ngories are typically used.2 Previous studies investigating\\nCAC scoring in CSCT4,14 deﬁned four risk groups (0, 1-\\n100, 101-400, [400). In this work, categorization of\\npatients in ﬁve risk groups was evaluated to allow\\ndifferentiation between zero and positive score patients,\\nas well as differentiation between low and intermediate\\nCVD risk patients.\\nClinically, it is of key importance to distinguish\\npatients without any calcium and those with positive\\nscores. Thirteen patients had a zero calcium score on\\ndedicated CSCT scan. Manual calcium scoring in CTAC\\nscans at rest and stress identiﬁed 12 and 13 of those 13\\npatients, respectively. However, 5 and 7 additional\\npatients were assigned to the very low CVD risk in scans\\nat rest and stress, respectively. Automatic calcium\\nscoring identiﬁed 13 and 11 of the 13 zero score\\npatients but assigned 11 and 9 additional patients to the\\nvery low CVD risk group in CTAC at rest and stress,\\nrespectively. This demonstrates that CTAC images\\nunderestimate CVD risk even when expert manual\\nannotations are performed. This might be due to high\\nlevels of image noise, cardiac motion artifacts, and\\nespecially partial volume effects, but further research is\\nneeded to reveal the causes.\\nComparison of CAC scores between CTAC and\\nCSCT scans is hampered by differences in image\\nacquisition. Due to low in-plane resolution in CTAC\\ncompared with CSCT scans (*1.35 vs *0.35 mm),\\ndifferent tube voltages (100 vs 120 kVp) and lack of\\nECG gating on CTAC images, we can hardly expect to\\nobtain the same CAC scores in CTAC and CSCT. The\\nresults demonstrated that CAC scores in CTAC images\\nwere signiﬁcantly lower than the CAC scores in CSCT,\\nboth when CTAC images were scored manually and\\nautomatically. To compensate for differences in image\\nacquisition parameters, a previous study corrected the\\nscores obtained in coronary CT angiography scans by\\ndetermining a multiplication factor to convert Agatston\\nscores in coronary CT angiography to Agatston scores in\\nCSCT.15 However, this factor depends on the data at\\nhand and the assumption that the relationship between\\nthe scores is linear. Hence, we compensated for these\\ndifferences by ranking the CAC scores in CTAC scans,\\nas we can assume that CSCT provides the reference risk\\ncategory and that ranking of the CVD risk among the\\npatients remains the same regardless of the image\\nacquisition technique.13\\nThis study has several limitations. First, calcium\\nscoring in CTAC images was compared with clinically\\nacquired scores in CSCT scans by different observers. In\\naddition, during scoring of CTAC images, CSCT scans\\nwere not available for review. This allowed independent\\nscoring but it also likely introduced inter-observer\\nvariabilities thereby hampering exclusive evaluation of\\nthe automatic scoring. Separate scoring of CTAC and\\nCSCT scans have resulted in a decreased agreement\\nbetween both manual and automatic scores in CTAC\\nwith the scores in CSCT. Second, correspondence\\nbetween calciﬁcations in all available scans of the same\\npatient was not analyzed. Due to differences in image\\nacquisition, speciﬁcally partial volume effect and car-\\ndiac motion, this would have been very challenging.\\nConsequently, only patient-based analysis was per-\\nformed. However, this is in agreement with clinical\\nanalysis and previous studies.4,16,17 Third, CSCT scans\\nwere scored using scanner vendor software, while CAC\\nscoring in CTAC images was performed using custom\\nsoftware. This might have caused differences in CAC\\nquantiﬁcation. Nevertheless, we expect that the dis-\\nagreement caused by CAC quantiﬁcation software is\\nminor. Fourth, the speed of the automatic scoring\\nalgorithm was not at all optimized as it was imple-\\nmented within the research environment. It is likely that\\nTable 5.

Large scale adoption of Elec-\\ntronic Health Records (EHR) has created the opportunity to proactively identify patients with\\nhigh risk of hospital readmission, and apply effective interventions to mitigate that risk. To\\nthat end, in the past, numerous machine-learning models have been employed to predict\\nthe risk of 30-day hospital readmission. However, the need for an accurate and real-time\\npredictive model, suitable for hospital setting applications still exists. Here, using data from\\nmore than 300,000 hospital stays in California from Sutter Health’s EHR system, we built\\nand tested an artificial neural network (NN) model based on Google’s TensorFlow library.\\nThrough comparison with other traditional and non-traditional models, we demonstrated\\nthat neural networks are great candidates to capture the complexity and interdependency of\\nvarious data fields in EHRs. LACE, the current industry standard, showed a precision (PPV)\\nof 0.20 in identifying high-risk patients in our database. In contrast, our NN model yielded a\\nPPV of 0.24, which is a 20% improvement over LACE. Additionally, we discussed the pre-\\ndictive power of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data, and presented a simple cost\\nanalysis to assist hospitalists in implementing helpful and cost-effective post-discharge\\ninterventions.\\nIntroduction\\nSince the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in 2010, hospital readmission rates\\nhave received increasing attention as both a metric for the quality of care and a savings\\nopportunity for the American healthcare system [1]. Per American Hospital Association, the\\nnational readmission rate finally fell to 17.5% in 2013 after holding at approximately 19% for\\nseveral years [2]. Hospital readmissions cost more than $17 billion annually [3]. According to\\nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC), 76% of hospital readmissions are\\npotentially avoidable [4].\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181173\\nJuly 14, 2017\\n1 / 14\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\nOPEN ACCESS\\nCitation: Jamei M, Nisnevich A, Wetchler E, Sudat\\nS, Liu E (2017) Predicting all-cause risk of 30-day\\nhospital readmission using artificial neural\\nnetworks.

Through an internal review board\\nprocess (SH IRB # 2015.084EXP RDD), Sutter\\nHealth provided Bayes Impact with its patients\\nanonymized electronic medical records. Due to the\\nexistence of personally identifiable information (PII)\\nin the dataset, the authors cannot release this\\ndataset. Interested researchers could contact\\nSylvia Sudat (keuters@sutterhealth.org), a\\nsenior biostatistician, or Nicole Kwon\\n(KwonN1@sutterhealth.org), a Research Project\\nIn response, ACA has required the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to\\nreduce payments to hospitals with excess readmissions [5]. These penalties should be put in\\nthe context of a larger shift in healthcare from the current fee-for-service payment model to a\\nmore patient-centered value-based payment model. Formation of Accountable Care Organiza-\\ntions (ACO) and CMS’ Quality Payment Program are examples of this trend that has created\\nfinancial incentives for hospitals and care providers to address the readmission problem more\\nsystematically.\\nBefore establishing targeted intervention programs, it is important to first identify those\\npatients with a high risk of readmission. Fortunately, the widespread adoption of EHR systems\\nhas produced a vast amount of data that could help predict patients’ risk of future readmis-\\nsions. Numerous attempts to build such predictive models have been made [6–12]. However,\\nthe majority of them suffer from at least one of the following shortcomings: (1) the model is\\nnot predictive enough compared to LACE [11], the industry-standard scoring model [13], (2)\\nthe model uses insurance claim data, which would not be available in a real-time clinical set-\\nting [6,7], (3) the model does not consider social determinants of health (SDoH) [13,8], which\\nhave proven to be predictive [14], (4) the model is limited to a particular medical condition,\\nand thus, limited in scope [9,10].\\nTo address these shortcomings, we built a model to predict all-cause 30-day readmission\\nrisk, and added block-level census data as proxies for social determinants of health. Addition-\\nally, instead of using insurance claims data, which could take up to a month to process, we\\nbuilt our model on the data available during the inpatient stay or at the time of discharge. Gen-\\nerally, using real-time EHR data allows models to be employed in hospital setting applications.\\nParticularly, the authors are interested in applications of this predictive model in supporting\\ndata-driven post-discharge interventions to mitigate the risk of hospital readmission.\\nMethods\\nEthics\\nThis study was conducted using health record data (without patient names) taken from 20 hos-\\npitals across Sutter Health, a large nonprofit hospital network serving Northern California.\\nThe Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Sutter Health (SH IRB # 2015.084EXP RDD)\\napproved the study.\\nData preparation\\nElectronic health records corresponding to 323,813 inpatient stays were extracted from Sutter\\nHealth’s EPIC electronic record system. Table 1 shows a summary of the population under\\nstudy. We had access to all Sutter EHR data, beginning in 2009 and going through the end of\\n2015. Since many hospitals only recently completed their EHR integration, some 80% of the\\ndata comes from 2013–2015 (Fig 1). To ensure data consistency, we limited our hospitals of\\nstudy to those with over 3,000 inpatient records and excluded Skilled Nursing and other spe-\\ncialty facilities. Fig 2 shows the total number of records for each hospital, and their respective\\nreadmission rates.\\nWe studied all inpatient visits to all Sutter hospitals. Hospital transfers and elective admis-\\nsions were excluded. With this method, a 30-day boolean readmission label was created for\\neach hospital admission.\\nIn the current version of their EHR system, Sutter Health captures a few SDoH data fields,\\nsuch as history of alcohol and tobacco use. We supplemented those data with block-level 2010\\ncensus data [15] by matching patients’ addresses.

In each case, a 5-fold cross validation, with\\n20% of the data kept hidden from the model, was performed. We found that the neural net-\\nwork models heavily outperformed other models in performance and recall, with the neural\\nnetwork model being about 10 times faster to train than the random forest model, the second\\nbest performing model. Therefore, we focused on optimizing the neural network model.\\nAfter evaluating a variety of neural network architectures, we found the best-performing\\nmodel to be a two-layer neural network, containing one dense hidden layer with half the size\\nof the input layer, and dropout nodes between all layers to prevent overfitting. Our model\\narchitecture can be seen in Fig 3. To train the neural network, we used the keras framework\\n[20] on top of Google’s TensorFlow [21] algorithm. We trained in batches of 64 samples using\\nthe Adam optimizer [22], limiting our training to 5 epochs because we found that any further\\ntraining tended to result in overfitting, as indicated by validation accuracy decreasing with\\neach epoch while training loss continued to improve.\\nInitially, we trained the model on 1667 features extracted from the dataset. We then\\nretrained the model using the top N features most correlated with 30-day readmission, for dif-\\nferent values of N. As shown in Fig 4, the model achieved over 95% of the optimal precision\\nwhen limited to the top 100 features, suggesting that 100 features is a reasonable cutoff for\\nachieving near-optimal performance at a fraction of the training time and model size required\\nfor the full model. Table 3 summarizes the features most correlated with readmission risk.\\nMeasuring a model’s performance cannot be completely separated from its intended use.\\nWhile one metric, AUC, is designed to measure model behavior across the full range of possi-\\nble uses, in practice risk models are only ever used to flag a minority patient population, and\\nso the statistic is not fully relevant. Metrics like precision and recall require a yes/no interven-\\ntion threshold before they can even be computed, something that we lack as this model is\\nnot slated for a specific clinical program. For simplification, we assumed the model would be\\nused in an intervention on the 25% of patients with the highest predicted risk. We chose 25%\\nbecause this is the fraction of patients that LACE naturally flags as high-risk, so we conserva-\\ntively compare to LACE on its best terms. Additionally, we wanted to understand the predic-\\ntive power of each set of features. To achieve that, we removed individual feature sets, one at a\\ntime, and compared the performance (in terms of AUC) with the best performing model.\\nProviders often want to focus their interventions on a specific patient population based on\\ntheir age, geography or medical condition. Therefore, it is important to measure how well the\\nmodel performs in each of those subpopulations. In addition, so far, CMS has penalized hospi-\\ntals for excessive readmission of patients with heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmo-\\nnary disease (COPD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia5. We compared the\\nperformance of our model against LACE in each of those subpopulations.\\nCost savings analysis\\nThe main objective of this research study is to build and pilot a predictive model to accurately\\nidentify high-risk patients, and support the implementation of valuable and cost-effective\\npost-discharge interventions. Therefore, a cost-saving analysis could assist decision makers to\\neffectively plan and optimize hospital resources.\\nPredicting hospital readmission with neural networks\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181173\\nJuly 14, 2017\\n6 / 14\\nThe optimal intervention threshold for maximizing cost savings depends on (1) the average\\ncost of a readmission, (2) the expected cost of intervention(s), and (3) the expected effective-\\nness of intervention(s). Then, we can calculate the expected savings from each given interven-\\ntion strategy as follows:\\nSavings\\n¼\\nExpected Benefits � Costs\\n¼\\nð# Correctly � Chosen InterventionsÞ � ðIntervention Success RateÞ\\n�ðReadmission CostÞ � ð# Total InterventionsÞ � ðIntervention CostÞ\\nFig 3.

This nonlinear nature of ANNs enables us to harness more pre-\\ndicitive power from the additional extracted EHR data fields beyond LACE’s four parameters.\\nFurthermore, neural networks are compact and can be incrementally retrained on new data\\nto avoid the “model drift” that occurs when a model trained on data too far back in the past\\nperforms progressively worse on future data that follows a different pattern.\\nThe TensorFlow framework provides several added benefits for training a readmission\\nmodel. First, TensorFlow can run in a variety of environments, whether on CPUs, GPUs, or\\ndistributed clusters. This means that the same kind of model can be trained in a variety of dif-\\nferent hospital IT architectures, and achieve optimal performance in each. Secondly, with the\\naid of high-level interfaces, such as keras, TensorFlow can model neural network architectures\\nin a very natural way. This enabled us to quickly experiment with different neural network set-\\nups to find the ideal configuration for the problem. Finally, TensorFlow is an actively main-\\ntained open-source project, and its performance improves continually through contributions\\nfrom the open-source machine-learning community.\\nA fair comparison of our model with results in existing literature is not feasible, because the\\nperformance of readmission risk models varies tremendously between different patient popu-\\nlations, and no previous readmission prediction work has been done on the Sutter Health\\npatient population. Even the LACE model’s performance varies in the literature from 0.596\\nAUC [10] to 0.684 AUC [11], which illustrates the impact of patient population on the accu-\\nracy of readmission prediction.\\nThe performance of our model (as measured by precision, recall, and AUC) within patient\\nsubgroups tends to be worse than the performance of the same model within the whole patient\\npopulation. Some of this performance drop can be explained by the fact that each subgroup\\nrepresents a reduced feature set to our model—for example, age is no longer as predictive a\\nfeature to when every patient in a subgroup has a similar age. Furthermore, our model tends to\\nperform on subgroups that LACE also has the worst performance on, such as patients aged 85\\n+ (Fig 5) or patients with heart failure (Fig 7), suggesting that certain patient subpopulations\\nhave significantly less predictable readmission patterns than the general patient population.\\nWe used two sources of SDoH features: health history questions (regarding tobacco, alco-\\nhol, and drug use) and block-level census data based on patient address. The health history fea-\\ntures had some predictive value, two of them (“no alcohol use” and “quit smoking”) being in\\nthe top 100 features most linearly correlated with readmission risk. However, the census fea-\\ntures were less predictive, with no features in the top 100 and only a few in the top 200 (such as\\npoverty rate and household income). Both feature sources suffered from drawbacks: the health\\nsurveys were both brief and incomplete for ~25% of patients, while the block-level census data\\nonly provided information about a patient’s neighborhood but not about the patient them-\\nselves. For SDoH features to provide significant predictive value, they would have to be both\\ncomprehensive and individualized.\\nSince this study was conducted on EHR data from Sutter Health network of hospitals in\\nCalifornia, it does not capture potential out-of-network hospital readmissions. To address this\\nlimitation, the dataset could be supplemented by state or national index hospital admissions to\\nbuild a more comprehensive dataset.\\nConclusions\\nIn this study, we successfully trained and tested a neural network model to predict the risk of\\npatients’ rehospitalization within 30 days of their discharge. This model has several advantages\\nover LACE, the current industry standard, and other proposed models in the literature\\nPredicting hospital readmission with neural networks\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181173\\nJuly 14, 2017\\n12 / 14\\nincluding (1) significantly better performance in predicting the readmission risk, (2) being\\nbased on real-time data from EHR, and thus applicable at the time discharge from hospital,\\nand (3) being compact and immune to model drift. Furthermore, to determine the classifier’s\\nlabeling threshold, we suggested a simple cost-saving optimization analysis.\\nFurther research is required to study the effect of more granular and structured social deter-\\nminants of health data on the model’s predictive power. Some studies [23] have shown that\\nnatural language processing (NLP) techniques could be used to extract SDoH data from\\npatient’s case notes. However, the most systematic method is to gather such data from SDoH\\nscreeners. Currently, multiple initiatives [24] are underway to standardize SDoH screeners,\\nand integrate them into EHR systems.\\nThe importance of reducing hospital readmissions, and therefore risk assessment, is likely\\nto only grow in importance in the years to come. We believe that predictive analytics in gen-\\neral, and modern machine-learning techniques in particular, are powerful tools that have to be\\nfully exploited in this field.\\nSoftware release\\nThe neural network model described in the paper, as well as the code to run it on EMR data, is\\navailable (under the Apache license) at https://github.com/bayesimpact/readmission-risk.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) for supporting\\nthis research study.

Bayesian networks are a novel method for probabilistic modeling in\\nartiﬁcial intelligence, risk modeling, and machine learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of Bayesian\\nnetworks for biomechanical modeling using a static biomechanical model of spinal forces during lifting. A 20-node Bayesian\\nnetwork model was used to implement a well-established static two-dimensional biomechanical model for predicting L5/S1\\ncompression and shear forces. The model was also implemented as a Monte Carlo simulation in MATLAB. Mean L5/S1 spinal\\ncompression force estimates diﬀered by 0.8%, and shear force estimates were the same. The model was extended to incorporate\\nevidence about disc injury, which can modify the prior probability estimates to provide posterior probability estimates of spinal\\ncompression force. An example showed that changing disc injury status from false to true increased the estimate of mean L5/S1\\ncompression force by 14.7%. This work shows that Bayesian networks can be used to implement a whole-body biomechanical\\nmodel used in occupational biomechanics and incorporate disc injury.\\n1. Introduction\\nStochastic\\nmodeling\\nhas\\nbecome\\na\\nuseful\\nanalytical\\nmethod in biomechanics over the last twenty years.\\nApplications have included lumbar region muscle forces\\n[1], musculoskeletal injury risk prediction [2–4], upper\\nextremity joint mechanics [5–8] muscle modeling [9],\\npopulation\\nmorphological\\nmodeling\\n[10],\\nprobabilistic\\nsensitivity analyses [11], tissue repair [12], and orthopae-\\ndic implant design [13, 14]. Past stochastic biomechani-\\ncal models use Monte Carlo simulation, advanced mean\\nvalue theorem, or Markov chain models. Unfortunately,\\nthese methods are all “forward” simulation methods that\\nproduce probability estimates of outcomes based on model\\ninputs represented as random variables.\\nBayesian networks are well established in artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence [15, 16], risk analysis [17], and reliability engineering\\n[18–21] and have the potential to enhance biomechanical\\nmodeling. A Bayesian network is a graphical probabilistic\\nmodel containing nodes and directed edges that can be used\\nto compute probabilities when evidence has been entered at a\\nvariety of nodes in the graph, some of which are descendants\\nof the primary variable of interest [22]. Consider the problem\\nof predicting lumbar spine compression force during lifting,\\nwhich is a common task in occupational biomechanics. Exist-\\ning biomechanical models require task-related inputs like\\nmass in the hands, anthropometry, and joint angles to predict\\ncompression force [23, 24]. Physiologically driven models\\nalso require electromyographic measurements [25–28]. The\\nresults of these models are predictions of spinal compression\\nand shear forces. In theory, a Bayesian network could be used\\nto also incorporate intervertebral disc injury status, which\\nexisting models cannot.\\nTherefore, the purpose of this project was to evaluate\\nthe feasibility of implementing a well-established static\\ntwo-dimensional biomechanical model of lifting as a\\nHindawi\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\nVolume 2017, Article ID 2014961, 7 pages\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2014961\\nBayesian network and extend it to include disc prolapse as a\\nmodel input.\\n2. Methods\\nThe design of this study consisted of ﬁve steps: (1) implement\\na well-established deterministic static two-dimensional bio-\\nmechanical model for predicting L5/S1 shear and compres-\\nsion force as a Bayesian network, (2) extend the Bayesian\\nnetwork to include uncertainty in model inputs, (3) verify\\nthe implementation, (4) augment model to include disc\\ninjury status, and (5) evaluate eﬀect of including disc injury\\nstatus on L5/S1 compression force estimates.\\nA well-established deterministic model for predicting L5/\\nS1 compression force during lifting was selected as the basis\\nfor this model [29] (pp. 130-131). This model computes\\nintersegmental reaction forces and moments at the elbow,\\nshoulder, and L5/S1 disc. Body segment lengths and masses\\nare scaled from status and total body mass, respectively.\\nThe location of the center of mass for each segment is scaled\\nto segment length. All necessary body segment anthropomet-\\nric parameters are described in Chaﬃn et al. [29] (pp. 41–47).\\nThe model allows for a downward directed hand force repre-\\nsenting the holding of an object in the hands. The model is\\nbilaterally symmetric. A 50th-percentile female (161.8 cm\\nstature and 65.6 kg body mass) was used for all simulations.\\nThe erector spinae moment arm was 5.3 cm according to\\nChaﬃn et al.’s recommendation for models not incorporat-\\ning intra-abdominal pressure (p. 134).\\nThe deterministic and stochastic versions of the lifting\\nmodel were also coded in MATLAB R2014a (The Math-\\nworks, Natick, MA) for purposes of validation. Monte Carlo\\nsimulation was used for the stochastic simulation, and each\\nsimulation contained 107 iterations. Hand calculations were\\nalso performed for selected deterministic cases for code\\nveriﬁcation.\\nThe next step was to implement the same model as a\\nBayesian network [30] using AgenaRisk software (Agena,\\nCambridge, UK). A Bayesian network is a graphical probabi-\\nlistic modeling framework developed initially in artiﬁcial\\nintelligence [15, 16]. A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic\\ngraph in which the directed edges represent conditional\\nindependence assumptions and node probability tables\\nare associated with each node. Each node represents a ran-\\ndom variable. The probability table associated with a node\\nconsists of a full statement of conditional probabilities for\\nall nodes that are parents of the node. It is also possible to\\ncode deterministic relationships between nodes. Probability\\ndistributions can be deﬁned for nodes, as well as observed\\nvalues of the random variables. Junction tree methods are\\nused to propagate probability distributions through the\\nnetwork [31].\\nIn the Bayesian network implementation of the lifting\\nmodel, nodes for input data were deﬁned: mass in hands,\\nelbow angle, shoulder angle, torso angle, knee angle, and ankle\\nangle (Figure 1). Note that in this paper, variables are indi-\\ncated in italics. Intermediate nodes were also deﬁned for pur-\\nposes of computation. Nodes were introduced for the\\nreaction forces and moments at the elbow (elbow reaction\\nforce and elbow reaction moment), shoulder (shoulder reac-\\ntion force and shoulder reaction moment), and L5/S1 level\\n(L5/S1 reaction force and L5/S1 reaction moment). A node\\nwas created for the erector spinae moment arm, and another\\nfor erector spine force. The eﬀect if intra-abdominal pressure\\nwas excluded because of the nonlinearity of the relationship\\nbetween hip moment and pressure (p. 132). A node for\\nL5/S1 disc angle was included, as were three nodes (β, T,\\nand K) to implement a regression model for predicting devi-\\nation of disc angle from 40 degrees [32], which is how Chaﬃn\\net al. compute disc angle (p. 132). Two output nodes were\\ndeﬁned: (1) L5/S1 compression force and (2) L5/S1 shear force.\\nEdges were introduced to link the nodes in a way that repre-\\nsented mechanics. In AgenaRisk, each arc was given the\\ndeterministic relationships linking nodes. This deﬁned the\\ndeterministic version of the lifting model.\\nThe model was extended to a stochastic model by modi-\\nfying the input nodes to be normally distributed random var-\\niables rather than deterministic values. Liu et al. [33] showed\\nthat assessment of body segment angles for a lifting model\\nusing common ergonomics tools has measurement error\\nand these error estimates were used to deﬁne the standard\\ndeviation for each joint angle. Since Liu et al. [33] reported\\nmean absolute errors, normality was assumed and the result\\nof Geary [34] was used to compute standard deviation for\\nthe elbow, shoulder, and torso angles. The standard deviation\\nfor the error across all joints was also computed, and this was\\nused for the knee and ankle.\\nThe method was evaluated on a lifting task obtained from\\na study of heavy work that has been previously reported [35].\\nThe task involved lifting chunks of carbon that had broken\\noﬀ large anodes in an aluminum smelter. Posture was col-\\nlected from video of the job taken from a single viewpoint.\\nThe postural measurements were subject to error as shown\\nby Liu et al. [33], and hand load was random because\\nthe carbon pieces broke oﬀ from anodes by a process that\\ncreated a wide distribution of masses. Therefore, both pos-\\nture and hand load were modeled as normally distributed\\nrandom variables. Table 1 provides the mean (and stan-\\ndard deviation) joint angles. The mass of the object in\\nthe hands was modeled as a normally distributed random\\nvariable having mean and standard deviation of 53.1 kg\\nand 12.8 kg, respectively.\\nA modiﬁed model was developed that incorporates\\nintervertebral disc prolapse status (a so-called “injury-\\naugmented” model). It is the full DAG shown in Figure 1.\\nIt was developed by adding a probabilistic inference model\\nof structural failure in which failure occurs when the applied\\nload exceeds the compressive strength. Both applied load\\nand strength were modeled as random variables [36].\\nTherefore, a node for intervertebral disc compressive\\nstrength was added. The distribution of compressive strength\\nwas assumed to be normally distributed. The mean (5448 N)\\nand standard deviation (2366 N) values were taken from\\nreports of cadaver testing [37]. A disc prolapse Boolean\\nvariable node was added that took on a true value if and only\\nif the compression force exceeded the disc compressive\\nstrength. For the numerical example analyzed to illustrate\\nthe method, separate simulations were performed for three\\n2\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\nMass in\\nhands\\nTorso angle\\nShoulder angle\\nElbow angle\\nL5/S1 reaction\\nmoment\\nShoulder reaction\\nmoment\\nElbow reaction\\nmoment\\nElbow reaction\\nforce\\nShoulder reaction\\nforce\\nL5/S1 reaction\\nforce\\nErector spinae\\nforce\\nErector spinae\\nmoment arm\\nT\\nK\\n\u0001훽\\nKnee angle\\nAnkle angle\\nL5/S1 shear force\\nL5/S1 compression\\nforce\\nL5/S1 disc \\nangle\\nDisc compression\\nstrength\\nDisc injury\\nFigure 1: Bayesian network implementation of a two-dimensional top-down lifting model described by Chaﬃn et al. [29] (pp. 130–134). The\\n“basic model” is the DAG outside the dashed rectangle at the bottom; the “injury-augmented model” is the entire DAG including the two\\nnodes and edges inside the dashed rectangle at the bottom. Input variables are represented as gray nodes (mass in hands, elbow angle,\\nshoulder angle, torso angle, knee angle, and ankle angle). The angles are deﬁned relative to the horizontal. Intermediate angles T (torso\\nangle from vertical) and K (included knee angle) are computed from input angles to reduce the complexity of the expression in β, which\\nwas the deviation of the disc angle from 40°. This was done to facilitate computation. Joint reaction forces and moments are calculated for\\nthe elbow, shoulder, and L5/S1 levels because it is a top-down modeling approach. The line of action of the erector spinae muscle is\\nassumed to be perpendicular to the L5/S1 disc, so there is no directed edge from erector spinae force to L5/S1 shear force. The erector\\nspinae moment arm is treated as a constant (5.3 cm) and has its own node. The variables to be predicted in this model are the L5/S1\\ncompression force and L5/S1 shear force, and they are denoted as blue nodes. The injury-augmented model was created by adding the\\nnodes contained in the dashed rectangle (disc injury and disc compression strength); these implement the inference model of disc\\nfailure based on structural reliability modeling. Because the disc injury node was an input in the injury-augmented model, its node\\nis shaded gray.\\n3\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\ninjury conditions: (1) no disc injury evidence entered, (2)\\ndisc injury Boolean variable set to false, and (3) disc injury\\nBoolean variable set to true. The model also included\\nmodeling postures and hand loads as random variables\\nas described above.\\n3. Results\\nThe deterministic model implemented as a Bayesian network\\nproduced L5/S1 compression force estimates that were\\nwithin 1.4 N (0.04%) of the MATLAB implementation\\npredictions (Table 2). Similarly, both deterministic model\\nversions produced the same L5/S1 shear force estimate. This\\ndemonstrates veriﬁcation of the deterministic implementa-\\ntion. The Bayesian network basic model in which the joint\\nangles were modeled as random variables produced greater\\naverage L5/S1 compression force than the MATLAB imple-\\nmentation. However, the diﬀerence in means was only\\n28.5 N (0.8%). When hand load was simulated as a random\\nvariable, the diﬀerence in means was only 3.8 N (0.1%). For\\nthe random posture case, the 25th percentile, median, and\\n75th percentile of the compression force distribution were\\nwithin 290.2 N (4.5%), 1.6 N (0.05%), and 261.9 N (7.0%) of\\nthe MATLAB code Monte Carlo implementation results.\\nThe injury-augmented model’s predicted L5/S1 compres-\\nsion force changed as evidence was entered at the injury node.\\nWhen evidence of no injury (disc injury = false) was entered\\nat the injury node, the mean compression force was\\n3190.2 N (SD 789.3). However, when evidence of injury (disc\\ninjury = true) was entered, the predicted mean compression\\nforce increased to 3660.9 N (SD 820.0). This was an increase\\nof 470.7 N (14.7%). Moreover, the injury evidence shifted the\\nentire distribution. The 25th percentile value went from\\n2664.1 N to 3095.9 N when disc injury was changed from\\nfalse to true; the 75th percentile similarly increased from\\n3690.1 N to 4180.1 N going from false to true. Predicted\\nmean L5/S1 shear force also changed from 673.1 N (SD\\n108.9) to 715.7 N (SD 111.0) when disc injury was changed\\nfrom false to true.\\n4. Discussion\\nThis project demonstrated the ability of implementing a bio-\\nmechanical force prediction as a Bayesian network. The error\\nbetween mean L5/S1 compression force estimates was small\\n(&lt;1%), and it was lower when modeling hand load as a ran-\\ndom variable than when modeling joint angles as random\\nvariables. While Bayesian networks have had limited use in\\nbiomechanical data analysis, they have not been used to\\nimplement whole-body biomechanical models.\\nA Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\\nwhose nodes encode conditional probability statements\\nand edges reﬂect conditional independence assumptions.\\nDirected edges can be thought of as indicating causal rela-\\ntionships [38]. Directed paths in the DAG can also represent\\ncausal structures. In the ﬁrst model developed (Figure 1), a\\nDAG is constructed so that directed paths go from input var-\\niables (mass in hands, elbow angle, etc.) and internal struc-\\ntural variables (erector spinae moment arm, L5/S1 disc\\nangle, etc.) to low back kinetic variables (L5/S1 shear force\\nand L5/S1 compression force). This “basic model,” which\\nmerely implements the standard model of Chaﬃn, is the\\nDAG shown outside of the dashed rectangle in Figure 1. Cal-\\nculations on this network are straightforward and do not\\nrequire Bayes’ theorem. However, the full power of a Bayes-\\nian network is apparent when Bayes’ theorem is used to cal-\\nculate probabilities backwards along directed paths. The\\ninjury-augmented model (entire network in Figure 1) does\\nthis. Moreover, the injury-augmented model uses both the\\ninput data required for the basic model (Figure 1) and disc\\nprolapse status (disc injury node in Figure 1 denoting the\\nBoolean variable describing whether the person being ana-\\nlyzed has a prolapsed disc or not). The diﬀerence was\\n14.7%, which demonstrates the impact incorporating disc\\ninjury status can have on spinal compression force estimates.\\nAnother interesting feature of calculations performed on\\na Bayesian network is how the disc injury variable aﬀects L5/\\nS1 shear force. Note that the disc injury node is a descendant\\nof the L5/S1 shear force node, yet changing disc injury from\\nfalse to true increases the mean L5/S1 shear force from\\n673.1 N to 715.7 N. If it is a descendant, how can it aﬀect\\nL5/S1 shear force? It is because there is—in terminology from\\ngraphical causal modeling—a “trek” from disc injury to\\nL5/S1 shear force that does not contain a collider node\\n[39]. Changing the value of disc injury from false to true\\naﬀects L5/S1 reaction force through L5/S1 compression force\\nbecause of Bayes’ theorem. In turn, L5/S1 reaction force\\naﬀects L5/S1 shear force. A similar eﬀect could occur via the\\nL5/S1 disc angle node.\\nExisting stochastic simulation methods are forward\\nmethods that propagate probability from distributions of\\ninput parameters to distributions of outputs. Previously,\\nMonte Carlo simulation has been the most common tool\\nfor introducing probabilistic elements into deterministic bio-\\nmechanical models [1–4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 40]. While intuitively\\neasy to implement, Monte Carlo techniques are computa-\\ntionally intensive. Laz et al. [14] introduced the use of the\\nadvanced mean value theorem approach to probabilistic sim-\\nulation in biomechanics. Markov chain models have also\\nbeen used for stochastic modeling of soft-tissue failure [12].\\nIn Bayesian network parlance, all of these methods place\\nthe input variables on nodes that are ancestors of the variable\\nto be predicted. Variables that are graph-theoretic descen-\\ndants of the predicted variable cannot inﬂuence the predic-\\ntions. This makes it impossible to include injury status into\\nthe calculation of spinal compression and shear forces using\\nexisting probabilistic methods.\\nTable 1: Model input posture parameters.\\nJoint\\nAngle from horizontal\\n(degrees)\\nStandard deviation\\n(degrees)\\nAnkle\\n82\\n9.4\\nKnee\\n114\\n9.4\\nTorso\\n40\\n6.3\\nShoulder\\n192\\n7.9\\nElbow\\n−56\\n11.8\\n4\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\nThe most signiﬁcant limitation of the Bayesian net-\\nwork implementation of the model was the diﬃculty in\\npredicting the tails of the spinal compression force distri-\\nbution. Speciﬁcally, there was a diﬀerence of 7% for the\\n75th percentile. An additional limitation was that the\\nBayesian network produced a better estimate of the mean\\ncompression force when the hand load was modeled as a\\nrandom variable than when the joint angles were random.\\nThis is because the eﬀect of joint angles on spinal com-\\npression force is nonlinear.\\nComparisons of these results to other Bayesian network\\nmodels in biomechanics are diﬃcult because so few applica-\\ntions of Bayesian networks exist in biomechanics. Van Gestel\\net al. [41] and Lo et al. [42] used a Bayesian network for gait\\nclassiﬁcation, but neither used the Bayesian network to\\nimplement a biomechanical model. Ma et al. [43] used a\\nBayesian network to analyze spinal kinematics in patients\\nhaving low bone mineral density. Again, no biomechanical\\nmodel was used. Bayesian networks have also been used in\\nthe analysis of clinical data related to degenerative disease\\nof the lumbar spine. Takenaka and Aono [44] used a Bayes-\\nian network to develop a classiﬁer for lower extremity muscle\\nstrength for patients presenting with drop foot following\\nlumbar spinal decompression surgery.\\nA diﬀerent comparison to existing literature can be\\nmade by noting the similarity to work done in the struc-\\ntural reliability area. The model developed here considers\\ndisc prolapse to occur when the applied load exceeds the\\ncompressive strength of the intervertebral disc to withstand\\nload [36]. In this context, the current model can be viewed\\nas using a stochastic biomechanical model to predict the load\\nand cadaver testing to provide strength data. Thus, there is a\\nconceptual connection to work implementing interference\\nmodels in structural reliability models using Bayesian net-\\nworks [45]. Donnell et al. [12] have also used the interference\\nmodel of structural failure in biomechanics, although not\\nimplemented as a Bayesian network.\\nThis model takes a simplistic view of spinal injury\\nmechanics to highlight the Bayesian network modeling tech-\\nnique; future work should include subtle factors. The disc\\ncompression limit came from a study [37] that tested spinal\\nmotion segments in mild ﬂexion, matching the lifting posture\\nsimulated. However, it used a single load to failure test para-\\ndigm, where other authors argue that cyclic loading is a very\\nimportant factor in intervertebral disc failure [46, 47]. The\\ncurrent model also only considered compression in disc\\ninjury; the eﬀects of shear should also be investigated [48].\\nIn conclusion, this is a novel contribution to low back\\nmodeling because heretofore, biomechanical models pre-\\ndicted spinal compression force from posture and hand load\\nwithout consideration of disc injury status. It is Bayes’ theo-\\nrem that allows for disc injury, which is a graph-theoretic\\ndescendant of L5/S1 compression force on the causal directed\\npath, to inﬂuence the estimate of L5/S1 compression force.\\nThis innovation may be useful in areas such as litigation,\\nfor example, where the analysis is being done to estimate\\nwhether compression force exceeds a recommended thresh-\\nold for a speciﬁc person who has experienced a prolapsed\\nintervertebral disc.\\nConflicts of Interest\\nThere are no competing interests.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the Department of Orthopaedic\\nSurgery of the University of Michigan.\\nReferences\\n[1] G.

Introduction\\nAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative dis-\\nease whose clinical manifestations are mainly memory degrada-\\ntion\\nand\\ncognitive\\nfunction\\nimpairment,\\nwhich\\nseriously\\nthreatens the quality and safety of life of the seniors (Coleman\\net al., 2017). Fig. 1 shows the brains of AD patients presented by\\ntomography. Research has suggested that the incidence rate of\\ndementia among seniors over 65 years old in European and Amer-\\nican countries is about 4–8%, while the incidence rate of dementia\\nin China is 7.8%, in which the incidence rate of AD is 4.8%\\n(Smailagic et al., 2018). As the country with the largest population\\nin the world, China is about to face the increasingly serious prob-\\nlem of population aging, and AD would bring enormous economic\\nand living burdens to patients, families, and the society (Oliveira\\net al., 2018).\\nBased on the malignant degradation of cognitive and physical\\nfunctions of patients, clinically, AD is divided into 3 stages, i.e.\\nthe pre-clinical stage, the mild cognitive function impairment\\nstage, and the dementia stage (Jiang et al., 2018). In the pre-\\nclinical stage, the early pathological onset of the disease begins\\nin the cerebral cortex, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), and blood circula-\\ntion of the patient; however, no signiﬁcant clinical manifestations\\nare observed, as shown in Fig. 2. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\\nis a transitional stage between normal aging and the progression to\\nAD. The thinking ability and memory of MCI patients are degraded\\nmildly, which would affect the daily communication of MCI\\npatients (Ma et al., 2018). A survey has suggested that about\\n10–15% MCI patients are progressed to AD annually, while the\\ntransformation rate of AD among normal seniors is only 1–2%; in\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2019.12.004\\n1319-562X/� 2019 The Author(s).

Thus, it is seen that MCI is more\\nlikely to be further developed into AD, which can be used as a\\nkey breakthrough in the early diagnosis of AD.\\nAt present, the clinical examination methods of AD mainly\\ninclude cerebrospinal ﬂuid examination, electroencephalogram\\nexamination,\\nneuropsychological\\nexamination,\\nneuroimaging\\nexamination, and the latest genetic detection and molecular probe\\ndetection. Neuroimaging is widely used in the ﬁeld of assisted\\ndiagnosis for the cerebral disease. It can provide rich information\\nabout brain structure or brain functions and help researchers ana-\\nlyze the conditions of patients from various angles, making the\\nearly diagnosis of cerebral disease possible (Ferreira et al., 2017).\\nTherefore, MCI is an important point of penetration for the early\\ndiagnosis and prevention of AD. Based on the deep learning net-\\nwork model, a risk prediction model of AD was proposed in the\\nresearch to predict the transformation of AD from MCI in advance,\\nthereby effectively reducing the incidence rate of AD. Due to the\\ndifference in the types of data structures and the degrees of com-\\nplexity, the prediction effects obtained by different prediction\\nmodels applied to different ﬁelds are also different. According to\\nthe information obtained in the previous documents, the widely\\nused prediction models in the imaging ﬁeld include the support\\nvector machine and Lasso. The texture data of medical images have\\nstrong self-characteristics, including large data dimensions, large\\ndata variables, and a certain weak correlation between variables.\\nTo improve the risk prediction rate of AD, this study will further\\nexplore the key aspects of AD risk prediction based on the theoret-\\nical basis of deep learning and the 18F-FDG PET image data of the\\nbrain.\\n2. Materials and methods\\nA total of 350 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants\\nfrom the ADNI database were selected as the research objects; in\\naddition, the CAFFE was selected as the framework of the deep\\nlearning platform, the FDG PET image features of each participant\\nwere extracted by a deep convolution network model; then, a risk\\nprediction model of AD was constructed to predict the transforma-\\ntion of AD from MCI in the hope of reducing the incidence rate of\\nAD.\\n2.1. ADNI and research objects\\nThe Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a\\nglobal longitudinal multi-site observational study based on various\\napproaches such as comprehensive neuroimaging examinations,\\nassays of CSF and blood biomarkers, and clinical cognitive function\\nassessments, which aims to identify AD at an earlier stage and pro-\\nvide evidence for early diagnosis and treatment of AD.\\nResearch carried out in the ADNI database is divided into 3\\nstages, i.e. ADNI1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI2. The ﬁrst stage (ADNI1)\\nwas completed in October 2010. Completion institutions included\\na total of 57 research centers in the United States and Canada, with\\na total of 819 research objects included, in which 192 cases were\\nAD patients, 398 cases were mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\\npatients and 229 were normal aging populations. Fig. 3 compares\\nthe brain scans between healthy people and AD patients.\\nAfter the completion of the ﬁrst stage ADNI1, a two-year study\\nwas continued, which became the second stage ADNI-GO, with\\nnew patients added. The third stage is the ADNI2 stage. The respec-\\ntive inclusion criteria of each group in the ADNI-GO and ADNI2\\nstages are as follows:\\nThe normal control group (NC): The score of Mini-Mental State\\nExamination (MMSE) is between 24 and 30 points, and the Clinical\\nDementia Rating (CDR) score is 0 points; in order to avoid the\\npotential incidence risks of AD or MCI among the objects in the\\ngroup, all the objects should be 70-year-old seniors. The tracking\\nacquisition time is 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.\\nThe EMCI group: The MMSE score (Liu et al., 2018) is between\\n24 and 30 points, with complaints of memory impairment; in\\nterms of the scores obtained from the Logical Memory Assessment\\nScale in the Delayed Memory Scale (Rondina et al., 2018), the one\\nwhose education years exceed 16 years would get 9–11 points, the\\none whose education years are 8–15 years would get 5–9 points,\\nand the one whose education years are 0–7 years would get 3–6\\npoints, the CDR score is 0.5, the patient could take care of\\nFig. 1.

The tracking acquisition time of newly included objects in\\nADNI-GO is 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. The tracking acquisition time\\nof newly included objects in ADNI2 is 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.\\nThe LMCI group: The difference from EMCI is that it compares\\nthe degree of education with the loss of objective memory; the\\none whose education years exceed 16 years would get a maximum\\nof 8 points, the one whose education years are 8–15 years would\\nget 5–9 points, and the one whose education years are 0–7 years\\nwould get 3–6 points, and the other assessment criteria are the\\nsame as that of the EMCI group.\\nIn the research, a total of 350 MCI participants from the ADNI\\ndatabase were selected as the research objects to analyze their\\nFDG positron emission tomography (PET) images. Based on the\\nresearch needs and the follow-up records of the ADNI, all the\\n350 MCI participants were divided into MCIc and MCInc; informa-\\ntion of the participant is summarized in Table 1.\\n2.2. Deep learning framework\\nBased on actual needs, the CAFFE was selected as the frame-\\nwork of the deep learning platform. CAFFE was implemented in\\nC++ language and had Python and Matlab interfaces; it could\\nquickly realize the convolution neural network (CNN) on GPU\\nand conveniently convert between GPU and CPU. CAFFE had visual\\ninterfaces in the Linux operating environment, which provided a\\nrelatively sophisticated tool for the visualization of the deep\\nnetwork.\\nThe 3 basic results of the CAFFE framework were Blobs, Layers,\\nand Nets. The function of Blobs was to store and distribute various\\ndata; common Blobs were 4D vectors, including the ‘‘Number” that\\nrepresented the number of images and the ‘‘Channel” that repre-\\nsented the color channels of images, where the channel of the\\ngrayscale image was 1 and the channel of the 3-channel RGB was\\n3; in addition, ‘‘Height” and ‘‘Width” were used to indicate the\\nheights and widths of images respectively (Purandare et al., 2017).\\nIn the implementation process, CAFFE generally included the\\nnetwork layer and the pooling layer; the ‘‘Layers” are the basis\\nfor the realization of functions of various layers, which generally\\nincluded 3 steps, i.e. the construction of layers, the forward propa-\\ngation, and the back-propagation (BP). ‘‘Nets” generally consisted\\nof multiple layers, which deﬁned the entire network results as\\ninput and output, etc.; it was the integration of multiple ‘‘Layer”\\nlayers to form a complete network result. The operating principles\\nof the CAFFE framework are illustrated in Fig. 4.\\n2.3. Deep convolution network model and AlexNet\\nIn the research, the CNN network structure was trained by the\\ncombination of neural cognitive machine and BP algorithm; the\\nLeNet-5 model was used as the deep convolution network model;\\nthe network structure was illustrated in Fig. 5.\\nThe general network structure of a convolution neural network\\n(CNN) consists of an input layer, a convolution layer, a pooling\\nlayer, a full connected layer, and an output layer (Inui et al., 2017).\\nUsually, each convolution layer was composed of several fea-\\nture surfaces, and each feature surface had plenty neurons, which\\nwere locally connected to the input to extract the local features;\\nmeanwhile, each feature surface was interconnected and affected\\nthe relations with other feature spaces, and multiple feature maps\\nwould form new feature surfaces.\\nIn the process of convolution calculation, the convolution kernel\\nwas connected to a local region of the feature map, which was\\ncalled the local receptive ﬁeld. The weight of the convolution ker-\\nnel shared by the entire feature map was called weight sharing.\\nThe convolution-calculated feature maps could be expressed\\nthrough Eq. (1):\\nXl\\nj ¼ f\\nX\\ni2Mj\\nXl�1\\ni\\n� k\\nl\\nij þ b\\ni\\nj\\n0\\n@\\n1\\nA\\nð1Þ\\nThe output of the convolution layer was permitted by locally\\nweighting and transferring to a nonlinear activation function (such\\nas Sigmoid). Currently, the activation functions could be roughly\\ndivided into Sigmoid functions and non-Sigmoid functions, the\\nLeNet-5 used Sigmoid functions, which was expressed as Eq. (2)\\nf x\\nð Þ ¼\\n1\\n1 þ ex\\nð2Þ\\nGenerally, the convolution layer was closely followed by the\\npooling layer, which was also composed of several feature surfaces,\\nand each feature surface shared a unique correspondence relation-\\nship with the feature surface of the convolution layer; in addition,\\nthe pooling layer also had the features of weight sharing and local\\nconnection, and the main function was to reduce the dimensional-\\nity of images while preserving the original feature information of\\nimages, thereby the number of parameters during network training\\nwas reduced. The network after dimensionality reduction not only\\nreduced the computational complexity and the complexity of the\\nhidden layer but also made it easier to classify. The general form\\nof pooling was expressed by Eq. (3);\\nXl\\nj ¼ f wl\\njdownðXðl�1Þ\\nj\\nÞ þ b\\ni\\nj\\n�\\n�\\nð3Þ\\nThe pooling methods adopted in the research were max pooling\\nand average pooling. The pooling process was similar to the convo-\\nlution process, which moved in the order of from the top to the\\nbottom and from the left to the right. Max Pooling found the max-\\nimum value of the covered window as an element of the output\\nfeature map; Average Pooling found the average value of the cov-\\nered window as an element of the output feature map. Pooling\\nwas important for processing images with different sizes in actual\\nproblems; since the classiﬁcation layer must be uniformly ﬁxed,\\nthe image size could be uniﬁed by adjusting the paranoid size of\\nthe pooling layer.\\nTable 1\\nInformation on research objects.\\nMCIc\\nMCInc\\nTotal number\\n70\\n280\\nGender (male/female)\\n32/38\\n143/137\\nAge (yr)\\n71.7 ± 5.8\\n72.0 ± 5.9\\nEducational level\\n16.0 ± 2.4\\n16.3 ± 2.6\\nMMSE\\n27.1 ± 1.7\\n27.8 ± 1.5\\nFig. 4.

Liu / Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 27 (2020) 659–665\\n661\\nThe network structure of AlexNet included 8 layers of neural\\nnetworks, 5 convolution layers, and 3 full connected layers. Given\\nthe enormous data and network scale, it was necessary to put for-\\nward higher requirements for GPU video memory; therefore, the\\nAlexNet selected 2 GTX580 GPUs in parallel, and the video memory\\nof each GPU was 3 GB. The activation function of AlexNet was Rec-\\ntiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), which was expressed through Eq. (4):\\nf x\\nð Þ ¼ max 0; x\\nð\\nÞ\\nð4Þ\\nCompared with the saturated nonlinear activation functions\\nsuch as Sigmoid and tanh, ReLU not only solved the problems of\\ngradient explosion and disappearance but also greatly improved\\nthe convergence speed. The image of ReLU function was illustrated\\nin Fig. 6. In the dataset of Cifar-10, once the error rate of the con-\\nvolution of the 4th layer in AlexNet reduced to 25%, the conver-\\ngence\\nspeed\\nof\\nReLU\\nwas\\nnearly\\n6\\ntimes\\nfaster\\nthan\\nthe\\nconvergence speed of f x\\nð Þ ¼ tanh x\\nð Þ\\nj\\nj, which showed that ReLU\\ngreatly improved the learning efﬁciency.\\n2.4. Image data processing based on CAFFE and AlexNet\\nThe obtained image data were preprocessed; the detailed pro-\\ncessing steps were as follows:\\nThe PET images in the ADNI database were collected by using\\nthe PET scanners manufactured by General Electric (GE), Siemens,\\nand Philips. Before the image collection, researchers should con-\\nﬁrm that all participants had none of the following contraindica-\\ntions: (1) unable to complete the experiment (claustrophobia,\\netc.); (2) unable to lie on the scanning bed for 45 min (non-\\nquantitative study) or 75 min (quantitative study); (3) unable to\\nbe injected with tracers through venous accesses. Participants\\nwho were scanned in the morning should fast until the scans were\\ncompleted (with free access to water); participants who were\\nscanned in the afternoon should fast for more than 4 h. The correct\\npositioning of participants was a critical step to complete the PET\\nscans; in addition, it was necessary to ensure the accuracy of the\\npositions and the comfort of the participants. Besides, participants\\nshould leave their personal belongings out of the scan room, such\\nas wallets, keys, glasses, necklaces, earrings, and hearing aids, etc.\\nAdditional mats were placed under the neck of the participant to\\nprovide adequate support. A laser was used to ensure no rotations\\nin each plane. The head of the participant should be approximately\\nparallel to the imaginary line between the outer corner of the eye\\nand the outer ear canal. Supporting devices were provided for the\\nback and lower limb areas. In the quantitative study, it would be\\nbetter to place a small table at the edge of the scanning bed for tra-\\ncer management and venous blood draw, as well as for the partic-\\nipant to rest. In addition, an emergency button should be provided\\nto the participant, or a researcher was required to accompany the\\nparticipant to ensure the safety of the experiment. Environmental\\nstandardization was essential within 20–30 min after the injection\\nof 5 + 0.5 mCi (185 MBq) of the 18F-FDG tracer. During the tracer\\ningestion stage, participants should remain still and awake, with\\ntheir eyes widely opened and looked straight ahead. The lights\\nshould be dim remained unchanged throughout the overall acqui-\\nsition process. The participants were checked regularly to ensure\\ntheir eyes were open and they were conscious.\\nThe grid of voxel image re-sampled by the baseline PET image\\nregistration averaged image of each participant was oriented such\\nthat the front and rear axes of the participant were parallel to the\\nAC-PC line. Afterward, feature extraction was performed to the\\npreprocessed FEG-PET images. Feature extraction was an impor-\\ntant step in the study of classiﬁcation problems, which directly\\nrelated to the results of classiﬁcation. The feature extraction of\\ngeneral FDG PET images was mainly for the images themselves,\\nincluding the voxel or the metabolic intensity of the brain region.\\nIn addition, the histogram and the gray level concurrence matrix\\n(GLCM) of the gradient and direction were extracted from FDG\\nPET images as the features in some studies. After data preprocess-\\ning, the dimension of the gray matter density map of each partici-\\npant became 121 � 145 � 121, and the voxel size became a gray\\nmatter image of 1.5 � 1.5 � 1.5 mm3; however, the application\\nof AlexNet migration learning needed to satisfy the RGB 3-\\nchannel colored images whose sides were the same as those of\\nthe input images; therefore, the pre-processed gray matter images\\nshould be converted before the features were extracted by using\\nthe migration learning method.\\nThe image processing steps in the stage were implemented in\\nthe Windows 7 operating system by using the NifTi_2014 toolkit\\nloaded by MRIcro software and Matlab 2015b; the ﬁrst 3 steps\\nwere an interpolation, completion, and segmentation. After the\\n3rd step was output, the NifTi image of each participant was seg-\\nFig. 5. Convolution process of LeNet-5.\\nFig. 6. The schematic diagram of ReLU function.\\n662\\nZ. Yang, Z. Liu / Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 27 (2020) 659–665\\nmented averagely from the Z-axis into 65 images in PNG format.\\nFinally, all the grayscale images in the PNG format were converted\\ninto pseudo-colored images in the RGB format. The parameter vari-\\nations of the above-mentioned image conversion dimensions and\\nvoxels were summarized in Table 2.\\nAfter the data were prepared, all the images were transformed\\ninto Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) format. The fea-\\nture extraction process used the pre-trained CAFFE model, which\\nrequired to customize the primary input parameters such as the\\nsize of the network; afterward, the different layers were selected\\nbased on to the network structure to extract features respectively;\\nin addition, the features were extracted into LMDB format. After\\nthe features were extracted, based on the output parameters of\\neach layer in the network model, the feature rows were visualized.\\nAccording to the principle of feature migration, each prepro-\\ncessed brain image was visualized in the feature extraction of con-\\nv1, conv3, conv4, and conv5 of AlexNet, respectively. In the\\nresearch, the features of conv3, conv4, and conv5 were extracted,\\nand the features of the LMDB format were changed into feature\\nmatrices for subsequent classiﬁcation and prediction. Taking conv3\\nas an example, according to the model parameters of AlexNet, the\\nimage of each participant became data in 65 � 64,896 dimensions,\\nof which 64,896 was the output of conv3 13 � 13 � 384; however,\\nin terms of the next step of classiﬁcation, the image of each partic-\\nipant\\nwas\\nrecombined\\nin\\n3D,\\nand\\nthe\\ndimensions\\nreached\\n4,218,240, which was undoubtedly a dimensional disaster for the\\nclassiﬁer; therefore, the features of each participant were submit-\\nted to dimension reduction by overlapping polling, in which the\\nstep was 2, the size of pooling window was 3, i.e. S = 2, Z=; then,\\nthe conv3 and conv4 feature dimensions of each participant\\nbecame 1 � 898,560, and the conv5 feature dimension of each par-\\nticipant became 1 � 599,040.\\n2.5. Model construction of prediction and classiﬁcation\\nThe basic construction ﬂow of the classiﬁcation and prediction\\nmodel was illustrated in Fig. 7. During the image preprocessing\\nprocess, the original FDG PET image was converted into NifTi for-\\nmat, and the gray matter was extracted to generate the gray matter\\ndensity map; after the completion and segmentation, the image\\nwas converted to ﬁt the input size of AlexNet; next, the image\\nwas converted into 2D image in PNG format, which was then con-\\nverted into the LMDB format that CAFFE could recognize. During\\nthe\\nAlexNet-based\\nfeature\\nextraction\\nprocess,\\nfeatures\\nwere\\nsequentially extracted by setting input sizes and input batches that\\nmet the experimental requirements and the video memory. After-\\nward, the predictive model for MCIc and MCInc was constructed,\\nand a feature classiﬁcation set for the classiﬁcation models of EMCI\\nand LMCI was established. The PCA was input for dimension reduc-\\ntion; the training set was selected by using the SFS algorithm, and a\\ntotal of 20 most representative features of the training set were\\nselected. Since only 70 cases of MCIc were included, 40 cases were\\nselected as the training sets in the prediction model. Finally, the\\nselected features were input into the classiﬁer as the test set to\\nobtain the ﬁnal classiﬁcation results.\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Brain PET images of MCI participants\\nAfter the tracer was ingested, the brains of the MCI participants\\nwere scanned with PET and were compared with the brain PET\\nscans of the healthy participants. As shown in Fig. 8, compared\\nwith the healthy human brain, the brains of MCI participants began\\nto shrink, and part of the nervous system functions would gradu-\\nally degenerate.\\n3.2.

The set of constructed\\nmodels had a problem that the data set was very uneven; only\\n70 cases were included in MCIc, which may affect the accuracy\\nof the model.\\nThe problems of MCI transformation in the research were all\\nbased on the long-term collection of ADNI-GO and ADNI2; in addi-\\ntion, participants transformed from MCI to AD on a regular basis of\\ntime were unclassiﬁed; however, most previous studies would per-\\nform quantitative analysis to the MCI transformation in 3 months,\\n6 months, and 18 months. In addition to the time limit of the\\nresearch, only 70 cases of MCIc were selected from ADNI-GO and\\nADNI-2; if the transformation prediction was performed, the\\namount of data in each group may be smaller, which would lead\\nto more uneven data and eventually affected the classiﬁer to a\\nlarge extent.\\n3.3.

In the research, the full brain gray matter features were\\nused as the materials for feature extraction. As for the classiﬁcation\\nproblems of LMCI and EMCI in the conv5 layer, the accuracy was\\nFig. 8.

Conclusion\\nThe positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced nuclear\\nmedicine functional imaging technology used to observe metabolic\\nprocesses in vivo to help clinicians diagnose diseases. A total of 350\\nmild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants from the ADNI data-\\nbase were selected as the research objects; in addition, the CAFFE\\nwas selected as the framework of the deep learning platform, the\\nFDG PET image features of each participant were extracted by a\\ndeep convolution network model. Then, a prediction and classiﬁca-\\ntion model of AD was constructed and was applied to the MCI\\nstage, which achieved preferable classiﬁcation and transformation\\nprediction results.\\nThe risk prediction of AD based on the deep learning model of\\nbrain 18F-FDG PET discussed in the research matched the expected\\nresults, which achieved preferable predictive results in the prob-\\nlem of MCI transformation. According to the prediction results,\\nthe classiﬁcation of conv3 achieved good results in MCI transfor-\\nmation prediction, and the sensitivity and speciﬁcity were respec-\\ntively 91.02% and 77.63%, indicating that the model constructed in\\nthis study can be used in the MCI transformation. In addition, by\\nusing the whole-brain gray matter feature as the material for fea-\\nture extraction, 72.19% of accuracy was obtained in the classiﬁca-\\ntion problem of LMCI and EMCI in the conv5 layer, and the\\nsensitivity and speciﬁcity were also about 73%, indicating that\\nthe classiﬁcation model was effective for the classiﬁcation of EMCI\\nand LMCI. It provided a relatively accurate reference model for the\\nprediction of AD. However, certain deﬁciencies were found in the\\nresearch process, such as the limited database data, which led to\\nthe results that the accuracy of the constructed model was not\\nwell-veriﬁed. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the data capac-\\nity to further explore the accuracy of the AD risk prediction model\\nin subsequent research.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis study was funded by a grant from the National Natural\\nScience Foundation of China (Project No. 81871465).\\nReferences\\nColeman, R.A., Liang, C., Patel, R., et al., 2017.

They appear\\nto be better at prediction and classification in biological systems than do traditional strategies such as\\nlogistic regression. This paper provides a practical example that contrasts both approaches within the\\nsetting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room.\\nMethods The study population comprised patients with suspected bacterial infection as their main\\ndiagnosis for admission to the emergency room at two University-based hospitals. Mortality within the\\nfirst 28 days from admission was predicted using logistic regression with the following variables: age,\\nimmunosuppressive systemic disease, general systemic disease, Shock Index, temperature, respiratory\\nrate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, leucocyte counts, platelet counts and creatinine. Also, with the same\\ninput and output variables, a probabilistic neural network was trained with an adaptive genetic\\nalgorithm. The network had three neurone layers: 10 neurones in the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer\\nand two in the output layer. Calibration was measured using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit\\ntest and discrimination was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves.\\nResults A total of 533 patients were recruited and overall 28-day mortality was 19%. The factors\\nchosen by logistic regression (with their score in parentheses) were as follows: immunosuppressive\\nsystemic disease or general systemic disease (2), respiratory rate 24–33 breaths/min (1), respiratory\\nrate ≥ 34 breaths/min (3), Glasgow Come Scale score ≤12 (3), Shock Index ≥ 1.5 (2) and temperature\\n<38°C (2). The network included all variables and there were no significant differences in predictive\\nability between the approaches.

Despite new and\\ncomplex therapies, the incidence of sepsis has increased\\nannually at a constant rate over the past 20 years, and there\\nhave been no substantial changes in the associated mortality\\n[2].\\nA tool that could stratify the severity of sepsis from the initial\\nstages in the clinical course would enhance our understanding\\nof this disorder and its management. A simple system\\ndesigned to estimate the probability of death would represent\\nthe basis for improved diagnosis, prognostication and treat-\\nment. Specifically, such a model, in the setting of the emer-\\ngency room (ER), could guide decisions regarding ICU\\nadmission or whether a particular type of therapy should be\\ninstituted. The strategy may be developed from the definitions\\nproposed by the American College of Chest Physicians/Soci-\\nety of Critical Care Medicine in 1992 [3]. These definitions\\ninclude a generalized process with clinical findings that may\\nrepresent an initial phase during the sepsis phenomenon – the\\nsystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although\\nthe natural history seems to reflect a continuum through differ-\\nent stages of an inflammatory response, from SIRS to septic\\nshock [4], an unequivocal linear sequence of events is far from\\nclinically apparent. Thus, classical analytical models, such as\\nlogistic regression, are limited in terms of their ability to eluci-\\ndate the interplay that underlies the sepsis phenomenon.\\nAdvances in statistical methods have supplied the tools nec-\\nessary to model complex nonlinear relationships among many\\nvariables relevant to biological systems. Artificial neural net-\\nworks (ANNs) are computer programs that simulate some of\\nthe higher level functions of the human brain. As in the brain,\\nthere are neurones and synapses, with various synaptic con-\\nnection strengths – called 'weights' – for each connected pair\\nof neurones. However, unlike the brain but similar to many\\ncomputer programs, there is a specific set of input and output\\nneurones for each problem and each net. These input and out-\\nput neurones correspond to the inputs to and outputs from a\\ntraditional computer program. The other, termed 'hidden' neu-\\nrones, along with the synapses and weights, correspond to the\\ninstructions in a traditional program. Use of ANNs as clinical\\nprediction models has been explored in many areas of medi-\\ncine, including nephrology [5], microbiology [6], radiology [7]\\nand neurology [8]. Thus far, however, we are unaware of their\\nuse in sepsis. In this study we present a practical example that\\ncontrasts the abilities of logistic regression and neural net-\\nworks to predict death in patients admitted to the ER with sus-\\npected sepsis as their main cause of hospitalization.\\nMaterials and methods\\nStudy design\\nIn this longitudinal cohort study, patients were recruited\\nbetween August 1998 and March 1999. Starting from admis-\\nsion to the ER, the patients were followed for 28 days or until\\ndeath.\\nSetting\\nThe patients were admitted to the ERs of two reference hospi-\\ntals: the Hospital Universitario San Vicente de Paúl and the\\nHospital General de Medellín. Hospital Universitario San Vice-\\nnte de Paúl is a 550-bed, fourth level university hospital, and is\\na referral centre for a region including approximately 3 million\\nhabitants. Hospital General de Medellín is a 300-bed, third\\nlevel teaching hospital, and is a referral centre for the metro-\\npolitan area. Both are located in Medellín, Colombia.\\nParticipants\\nWe included patients aged 15 years or older with any sus-\\npected or confirmed bacterial infection as their admission\\ndiagnosis and at least one of the following SIRS criteria: tem-\\nperature >38°C or <36°C; and leucocyte count >12000/\\nmm3, <4000/mm3, or >10% immature forms (bands). We\\nexcluded eligible participants if they, their relatives, or their\\ndoctors refused to provide consent to participate in the study,\\nor if they died or were discharged before 24 hours. Ethics\\ncommittees of both hospitals had previously approved the pro-\\ntocol, and patients or their legal representatives signed an\\ninformed consent form.\\nMeasurements\\nThe primary outcome variable was mortality within the first 28\\ndays after admission to the ER. For those patients who were\\ndischarged before day 28, an evaluation of their vital status\\nwas conducted in the outpatient control centre or by phone if\\na personal interview was not possible. Independent variables\\nrecorded at admission were as follows: age, immunosuppres-\\nsive systemic disease (ISD; i.e. any of cancer, chemotherapy,\\nsteroid use or AIDS), general systemic disease (GSD; i.e. any\\nof cardiac failure, diabetes, renal failure, chronic obstructive\\nlung disease, or cirrhosis), Shock Index (heart rate/systolic\\narterial pressure), body temperature, respiratory rate, Glasgow\\nComa Scale (GCS) score, leucocyte count, platelet count and\\ncreatinine blood level. Research assistants in the ER collected\\nclinical variables at admission in a standardized manner. Lab-\\noratory variables were analyzed using standard quality control\\nprocedures at the participating institutions. Missing data for\\ncontinuous variables were estimated with simple imputations\\nusing the median nonmissing value. In total, estimation proce-\\ndures were performed in 2.6% (14 simple records) of baseline\\nvalues.\\nData analysis and management\\nThe procedure for the logistic model has been described in\\ndetail elsewhere [9]. Briefly, we conducted univariate logistic\\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/9/2/R150\\nR152\\nregression analysis for each candidate variable, with P < 0.25\\nbeing the criterion for acceptance in the model. Collinearity\\nwas checked with a matrix of correlations, using the Spearman\\nrank correlation coefficient between independent variables.\\nWe chose a conservative strategy, with r ≥ 0.4 in at least one\\ncorrelation as the criterion for multicollinearity. Logistic model\\nassumptions (i.e. no interaction terms and a linear relationship\\nbetween the logit and the continuous covariates) were veri-\\nfied. Then, a logistic regression analysis, employing a forward\\nstepwise inclusion method, was developed using a P value of\\n0.05 at entry. This automatic procedure was contrasted with a\\nbackward elimination method and with a full model that\\nincluded all of the candidate variables, in order to confirm the\\nvalidity and stability of our results. For continuous variables,\\nthe cutoff points for changes in the probability of death were\\nexplored with locally weighted regression analysis and the\\nlowess procedure [10]. According to the cutoff points\\ndetected, dummy variables were constructed and a new logis-\\ntic regression model was fitted with those variables. In order to\\nobtain the simplest score with the same scale within and\\nbetween ranges of physiological variables and co-morbid con-\\nditions, the regression coefficients were all divided by the low-\\nest one, and then rounded off to the nearest whole number, as\\nthe weight reflecting 'risk' for death for each variable. In defin-\\ning the severity levels by the size of the coefficients, compara-\\nble severity levels within variables or conditions were grouped\\ntogether. The global score for every patient in the cohort was\\ncalculated and a new logistic regression equation with the\\nscore as independent variable was fitted.\\nThe model calibration – observed mortality versus that pre-\\ndicted with the score – was evaluated using the Hosmer-\\nLemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The test result, under a χ2 dis-\\ntribution, provides a P value in which higher values (P > 0.05)\\nindicate nonsignificant differences between observed and\\npredicted mortality. The discriminatory ability – the capacity of\\nthe model to separate survivors from nonsurvivors, with 1.0\\nand 0.5 meaning perfect and random discrimination, respec-\\ntively – was determined using receiver operating characteristic\\n(ROC) curve analysis. Internal validation was done with 2000\\nbootstrap replications of the model. All statistical analyses\\nwere performed with Stata Statistical Software, Release 7.0\\n(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).\\nUsing the same input and output variables, a probabilistic neu-\\nral network was trained using an adaptive genetic algorithm\\n(NeuroShell©; Ward Systems Group Inc., Frederick, MD,\\nUSA). The network has three neurone layers, with 10 neurones\\nin the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer and two in the output\\nlayer, the latter indicating death versus survival. Of the cohort\\n75% was used to train the network and 25% was used in test-\\ning. The training criterion was that 20 generations had elapsed\\nwithout changes in the minimum error. The general perform-\\nance of the neural network was evaluated using the ROC\\ncurve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The\\ndifference between the two ROC curves – logistic regression\\nand neural network – was tested using the Wilcoxon statistic\\nbased on pairwise comparisons [11].\\nResults\\nA total of 542 potentially eligible participants were admitted\\nduring the study period. Nine were excluded because of death\\n(n = 5) or discharge (n = 4) during the first 24 hours. The final\\nstudy population therefore included 533 patients, 55% (n =\\n293) of whom were male. Their age (mean ± standard devia-\\ntion) was 48 ± 21 years, and their median hospital stay was 8\\ndays (interquartile range 4–15 days). Overall 28-day mortality\\nwas 19% (n = 101), and 14% (n = 75) of the cohort was\\nadmitted to ICU.\\nThe most common diagnoses suspected at admission were\\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia (recorded in 36% of\\npatients), followed by soft tissue infection (17%), intra-abdom-\\ninal infection (12%), urinary tract infection (11%) and others\\n(11%); sepsis of undetermined source was recorded in 13%\\npatients. The major pre-existing conditions related to admis-\\nsion were trauma or surgery more than 24 hours before admis-\\nsion (21%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12%),\\ndiabetes (13%) and miscellaneous others (9%). Of the\\npatients, 45% were free of associated diseases.\\nA total of 283 (53%) out of 533 cases of clinically suspected\\nbacterial infection were microbiologically confirmed, 113 of\\nwhich (40%) grew on blood samples. The rate of positive\\nblood cultures among the total requested was 27%, and the\\nmost frequently isolated micro-organisms were Escherichia\\ncoli (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Streptococcus\\npneumoniae (13%), Staphylococcus coagulase negative\\n(13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%), Enterobacter spp. (6%),\\nEnterococcus spp. (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), non-\\nfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (3%) and others (14%).\\nAfter conducting univariate analysis for the logistic regression,\\nleucocyte count was considered ineligible for inclusion in the\\nmodel (P = 0.893). The evaluation of collinearity was carried\\nout for all variables using the Spearman correlation coefficient.\\nA significant correlation (r = 0.44) was found between age and\\nGSD (P = 0.0000). Similar correlations, but to a lesser\\ndegree, were found between age and Shock Index (r =\\n0.1453; P = 0.0008) and between age and temperature (r =\\n0.1940; P = 0.0000). Therefore, age was excluded from the\\npredictor variables. A multiple logistic regression model was\\napplied to the overall 28-day mortality, taking into account\\nGSD, ISD, Shock Index, respiratory rate, temperature, GCS\\nscore, creatinine and platelet count as predictive variables.\\nThis model allowed us to discard the latter two variables\\nbecause they were statistically nonsignificant. For the varia-\\nbles respiratory rate, temperature, Shock Index and GCS\\nscore, the cutoff points for changes in the probability of death\\nCritical Care    April 2005\\n Vol 9 No 2    Jaimes et al.\\nR153\\nwere sought by locally weighted regression. The results are\\nshown in Table 1.\\nWith the previous values, 12 dummy variables were con-\\nstructed considering the first level (1) as the reference value.\\nThese new variables, in conjunction with the two nominal vari-\\nables previously involved (GSD and ISD), were fitted in a new\\nlogistic regression model for prediction of mortality. After divid-\\ning and rounding off coefficients to the nearest whole number,\\nsome levels and variables were bound together, namely co-\\nmorbid conditions, GCS score, Shock Index and body temper-\\nature. The final meaningful variables are summarized in Table\\n2 according to their levels and relative weights.\\nIn this way the final scale of severity was a range between 0\\nand 12. With these data, the score for each patient in the\\ncohort was calculated, and a model that provides an estimate\\nof severity, defined as the probability of 28-day mortality, was\\nobtained. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test yielded\\na value of 7.54 (P = 0.5807). By ROC curve analysis for dis-\\ncriminative capacity, the area under the curve was 0.7517.\\nThe bootstrapped coefficients for 2000 replications exhibited\\nstandard errors of under 10% of those observed in the model,\\nand the values for the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test\\nand the area under the ROC curve in this set were 8.96 (P =\\n0.4321) and 0.7119, respectively.\\nThe neural network included all of the independent variables.\\nTheir weight, by the smoothing factor, ranged from 2.65 for\\ntemperature to 0.34 for ISD. The Hosmer-Lemeshow good-\\nness-of-fit test yielded a value of 8.03 (P = 0.475), and the\\narea under the ROC curve was 0.8782. The difference\\nbetween ROC curves was statistically significant according to\\nthe Wilcoxon statistic based on pairwise comparisons (P =\\n0.037). Figure 1 shows the comparison of observed and pre-\\ndicted deaths with both methods.\\nDiscussion\\nThe present study shows that it is possible to obtain a simple\\nindicator of the risk for death under clinical conditions compat-\\nible with severe infections. The system uses variables taken\\nfrom the initial clinical interview and physical examination, all of\\nwhich are available at the moment of admission to the ER. This\\nsuggests that it is possible to develop a reproducible and\\ntransportable predictive instrument in patients with signs\\nindicative of sepsis. However, the model must be specifically\\ntested in an independent population with a larger sample size.\\nThe main determinants of mortality reflect two acknowledged\\nhost factors, namely co-morbid conditions and the type of\\nindividual biological response, the latter being determined\\nfrom clinical findings such as vital signs and GCS score.\\nThe use of ANNs in the setting of sepsis has not been\\nexplored.

Cler-\\nmont and coworkers [12] designed a prospective cohort study\\nincluding 1647 patients admitted to seven ICUs at a tertiary\\ncare centre. The predictor variables considered were age and\\nthe acute physiology variables of the Acute Physiology and\\nChronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score. They con-\\nstructed logistic regression and ANN models for a random set\\nof 1200 admissions (development set), and used the remain-\\ning 447 admissions as the validation set. Then, model con-\\nstruction was repeated on progressively smaller development\\nsets (800, 400 and 200 admissions) and re-tested in the orig-\\ninal validation set. As the size of the development set sample\\ndecreased, the performance of the model on the validation set\\ndeteriorated rapidly, although the ANNs retained marginally\\nbetter fit than logistic regression, as measured using the Hos-\\nmer-Lemeshow test, at 800 admissions. At under 800 admis-\\nsions, however, the fit was poor with both approaches. The\\nauthors concluded that both ANN and logistic regression have\\nsimilar performance with appropriate sample size, and share\\nthe same limitations with development sets on small samples.\\nNimgaonkar and coworkers [13] compared the performance\\nof the APACHE II score with that of a neural network in a med-\\nical-neurological ICU at a university hospital in Mumbai, India.\\nA total of 2062 consecutive admissions between 1996 and\\n1998 were evaluated. Data from 2962 patients were used to\\ntrain the neural network and data from the remaining 1000\\npatients were used to test the model and compare it with the\\nAPACHE II score. There were 337 deaths in these 1000\\npatients; APACHE II predicted 246 deaths whereas the neural\\nnetwork predicted 336 deaths. Calibration, as assessed using\\nthe Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, was better with the neural\\nnetwork than with APACHE II score, and so was discrimina-\\ntion. As probable explanations for this apparent superiority of\\nthe ANN, the authors suggested differences in demographic\\ncharacteristics and case-mix of patients in Indian ICUs. These\\nspecific features were certainly not accounted for in the origi-\\nnal Western cohorts used to develop and validate the\\nAPACHE score.\\nIn our research, both logistic regression and neural network\\nmodels did a good job of predicting death. Although there was\\na statistically significant difference in discrimination as meas-\\nured by ROC curve in favour of the neural network, the clinical\\nmeaning of this difference is not clear. A prediction model can-\\nnot be both perfectly reliable (i.e. calibrated) and perfectly dis-\\ncriminatory. According to Diamond [14], 'A model that\\nmaximizes discrimination does so at the expense of reliability\\n... On the other hand, a model that maximizes reliability does so\\nat the expense of discrimination, and thereby trades categori-\\ncal confidence for quantitative meaning.'\\nOne of the advantages of neural network analysis is that there\\nare few assumptions that must be verified before the models\\ncan be constructed; also, ANNs are able to model complex\\nnonlinear relationships between independent and dependent\\nvariables, and so they allow the inclusion of a large number of\\nvariables. The comparison method is supposed to constrain\\nthe neural network analysis by limiting the number of potential\\npredictor variables to the same set of predictor variables used\\nin the logistic regression analysis. However, in this practical\\nexample, our network was able to use all of the 10 initial varia-\\nFigure 1\\nObserved and predicted deaths with logistic regression and neural network in patients with suspected sepsis admitted to the emergency room\\nObserved and predicted deaths with logistic regression and neural network in patients with suspected sepsis admitted to the emergency room. \\nThere were no patients with scores 11 or 12 in the cohort.\\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1\\n1.2\\n0 (73)\\n1 (47)\\n2 (125)\\n3 (93)\\n4 (53)\\n5 (86)\\n6 (14)\\n7 (36)\\n8 (3)\\n9 (1)\\n10 (2)\\nScore (number of patients)\\nProbability of death\\nObserved\\nLogistic Model\\nNeural Network\\nCritical Care    April 2005\\n Vol 9 No 2    Jaimes et al.\\nR155\\nbles in its modelling, whereas logistic regression excluded four\\nvariables in the final model. Nevertheless, the predictive ability\\nwas almost the same with both approaches. A limitation of\\nANNs in the setting of aetiological research is that standard-\\nized coefficients and/or odds ratios corresponding to each\\nvariable cannot be calculated and presented as they can in\\nregression models. This lack of interpretability at the level of\\nindividual predictors is one of the most criticized features of\\nneural network models [15]. Furthermore, neural network\\nmodels require sophisticated software, and the computer\\nresources involved in training and testing neural networks can\\nbe substantial.\\nOur work has some limitations. First, the sample size – specif-\\nically the number of outcomes (101 deaths) – limit the number\\nof potential predictor variables. As a rule of thumb, no more\\nthat 10 outcome events for each independent variable are per-\\nmissible if over-fitting or under-fitting problems are to be\\navoided [16]. We tried to overcome this limitation by consid-\\nering just those variables that are more likely to be related to\\nmortality from a clinical point of view. However, as is usual in\\nany observational study, residual confounding or unmeasured\\nfactors may compromise the scope or precision of the model.\\nSecond, external validity was tested neither for logistic regres-\\nsion nor for the ANN. Furthermore, the small sample size pre-\\nvented a comprehensive split-sample validation with any\\nstrategy. Determination of the applicability and usefulness of\\nany predictive model requires independent and external valida-\\ntion in a population that is intrinsically different from the devel-\\nopment sample [17]. Therefore, both the proposed score and\\nthe neural network merit a new cohort study before any poten-\\ntial clinical use can be considered.\\nConclusion\\nA predictive model would be an extremely useful tool in the\\nsetting of suspected sepsis in the ER. It could serve both as a\\nguideline in medical decision-making regarding ICU admission\\nor specific therapies, and as a simple way to select or stratify\\npatients for clinical research. Our proposed model and the\\nspecific development method – either logistic regression or\\nneural networks – must be evaluated and validated in an inde-\\npendent population. Further research is required to determine\\nwhether there are practical or clinical advantages to one\\napproach over the other. As a general concept, we agree with\\nTu [15] that logistic regression remains the best choice when\\nthe primary goal of model development is to examine possible\\ncausal relationships among variables, but that some form of\\nhybrid technique incorporating the best features of both\\napproaches might lead to the development of optimal predic-\\ntion models.\\nCompeting interests\\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\\nAuthors' contributions\\nFJ conceived the study, participated in its design and coordi-\\nnation, performed the statistical analysis for logistic regres-\\nsion, and drafted the manuscript.

Computer techniques ranging from Information Re-\\ntrieval (IR) to Natural Language Processing can facilitate\\nautomated access to such patient records.1 Text classiﬁcation\\ncategorizes reports based on superﬁcial features of the text\\nas opposed to the deeper meaning of the language and may\\nbe easier to implement in clinical practice. In this study, we\\ncompare the ability of IR and statistical text categorization\\nalgorithms to identify patients (via x-ray reports) diagnosed\\nwith an acute fracture of the wrist (i.e., distal radius and/or\\nulna) out of all patients who had a forearm, wrist, or hand\\nx-ray.\\nFrom a technical perspective, this is not a trivial task, as\\nx-ray reports may describe old or other fractures and other\\ndiseases. From a clinical perspective, wrist fractures in older\\npatients are important to detect since treatment of osteopo-\\nrosis can decrease the risk of subsequent fractures. Auto-\\nmatic identiﬁcation of such patients would allow us to send\\nreminders to their physicians regarding osteoporosis man-\\nagement.\\nMethods\\nMaterial\\nTwo expert reviewers (AC, SO’D) classiﬁed 751 x-ray re-\\nports describing ﬁndings of a forearm, wrist, or hand x-ray\\nas consistent with the presence or absence of an acute wrist\\nfracture. Eligibility criteria included patients 40 years or\\nolder, seen at the Ottawa Hospital (an academic hospital in\\nEastern Ontario, Canada) between October 1, 2003 and\\nOctober 31, 2004. From the entire set of x-ray reports in this\\nperiod, we randomly selected 493 for derivation (included\\nﬁrst x-ray report in the study period) and 258 for validation\\n(included ﬁrst and last x-ray report). We used this selection\\nmethod for the validation set as we felt that, in future use,\\nthe text classiﬁer might need to evaluate repeat x-ray re-\\nports. The prevalence of acute wrist fractures was 43.2%\\n(213/493) and 34.1% (88/258) in the derivation and valida-\\ntion set respectively. The average length of all documents\\nwas 64 words, 95% had fewer than 150 words.\\nEvaluation\\nWe calculated the accuracy of the different text categori-\\nzation methods for correctly mimicking our manual clas-\\nsiﬁcations. Metrics were accuracy, sensitivity (or recall),\\nspeciﬁcity, and positive predictive value (PPV, or preci-\\nsion). We used a ten-fold cross-validation design that\\ninvolved randomly assigning reports to 1 of 10 sections or\\n’folds’; the model is then trained on 9 folds and tested on\\nthe 10th. Training and testing is repeated ten times so that\\neach fold serves as a test set once. Differences in accuracy\\nbetween classiﬁers in the 10-fold cross-validations were\\ntested for signiﬁcance with paired t-tests, pairing the\\nfolds.\\nPhase I\\nWe implemented three text classiﬁcation methods to auto-\\nmatically categorize the x-ray reports. The ﬁrst used an\\ninformation retrieval algorithm (IR-1) with a set of key\\nterms compiled by a radiologist.

Reports containing any of these predeﬁned terms were\\nclassiﬁed as ‘positive.’ To improve sensitivity, we truncated\\nthe terms to 4 characters and appended them with a wild-\\ncard character (method IR-1’).\\nFor the second technique (IR-2), we used terms selected by\\na computer based algorithm instead of an expert. This\\nfeature selection algorithm used Information Gain scores2\\nwhich are based on the number of times words or phrases\\nare observed in a positive or a negative document. The terms\\nwith the highest Information Gain were selected as features.\\nFor the third technique (TC-1), we used a machine-learning\\nalgorithm called a ‘support vector machine’ (SVM)3 which\\nhas been successful in data categorization. Information Gain\\nscores2 were used to select features for all reports, as with\\nIR-2. The SVM then used these features to create a decision\\ncriterion between ‘acute wrist fracture’ or ‘no such fracture’\\nfor new reports. Various parameter settings for the SVM and\\nthe feature selection phase were tested.\\nPhase II\\nWe compared the TC-1 results with 6 other machine learn-\\ning algorithms, as available in a benchmark toolkit named\\nWeka.4 Weka runs were repeated with various feature set\\nsizes, including a small (50) and large feature set (5000).\\nPhase III\\nWe validated TC-1 on a separate set of x-ray reports. This\\nvalidation set was kept quarantined until parameter opti-\\nmizing and training of the categorization model was com-\\npleted.\\nResults\\nPhase I\\nAlthough IR-1 showed high precision (or PPV) on the\\nderivation set (94.0%, Table 1) it missed almost half of the\\nwrist fracture cases (sensitivity � 51.6%). The overall accu-\\nracy of IR-1 was 77.7%. Using wildcards (IR-1’) improved\\nthe sensitivity to 68.1% at the expense of PPV (86.3%).\\nAccuracy rose to 81.5%. IR-2 had higher sensitivity (87.3%),\\nwhile the speciﬁcity remained high at 91.1% and PPV\\nslipped to 88.2%. IR-2 achieved an accuracy of 89.5%.\\nApplying the truncation and wildcard strategy within IR-2\\ndid not improve its performance (results not shown). The\\nTC-1 method was signiﬁcantly more accurate than the IR\\nmethods achieving an accuracy of 93.7% (p � 0.001, paired\\nt-test). The sensitivity and PPV were very good at 93.9% and\\n91.7% at the threshold setting that optimizes accuracy.\\nThe optimal parameters for the SVM were identiﬁed as:\\nlinear kernel, with the cost parameter that balances errors\\nwith a hard margin set to 0.005. Features were strings of one\\nto four words, no truncation was done and a stop word\\ncould not be a feature by itself but could be part of a\\nmulti-word feature. A maximum of 5,000 features was used.\\nThe cut-off (threshold) parameter was set to optimize accu-\\nracy; this parameter can be adjusted so that false-positives\\nand false-negatives trade off.\\nPhase II\\nUsing the same derivation set and cross-validation design,\\naccuracies for the Weka machine learning classiﬁers were:\\n84.6% (AdaBoost), 86.8% (K-Star), 87.2% (J48), 87.4% (Naive\\nBayes), 87.6% (JRip), and 88.0% (a Multi-layer Perceptron\\nneural network). All were signiﬁcantly lower than TC-1\\naccuracy (paired t-test, p � 0.001). The SMO algorithm in\\nWeka, an equivalent implementation of SVMs, achieved the\\nsame result as TC-1.\\nPhase III\\nTC-1 was applied to the previously quarantined validation\\nset, after it was retrained on the entire derivation set using\\nthe optimal parameter settings found in phase 1. Accuracy\\nof TC-1 was 93.8% at the default threshold (Table 1). A\\ncomparison of the derivation and validation ROC curves\\ndemonstrated that the TC-1 method discriminated between\\npositive and negative wrist fractures reports as accurately in\\nboth sets.\\nDiscussion\\nWe developed and validated an SVM based text classiﬁer\\nmethod (TC-1) which accurately categorizes textual wrist\\nx-ray reports into those with and without an acute wrist\\nfracture. Operating at 94% accuracy, TC-1 appears to be as\\nor more accurate than classiﬁers used on x-ray reports in\\nother studies such as Dreyer et al5 and Thomas et al,6\\nalthough a direct comparison of results is limited due to\\ndifferent study designs and data sets. TC-1 did outperform\\na number of well reputed classiﬁers on the same data set,\\nincluding Naive Bayes and a neural network. TC-1 test\\ncharacteristics stayed consistent when applied to a separate\\nvalidation set of x-ray reports, despite the different preva-\\nlence of positive x-rays.\\nTable 1 y Performance of IR-1, IR-1’, and TC-1 in the Derivation Set, and Validation Set (TC-1)\\nX-ray Reports\\nMethod\\nTP FP\\nFN TN\\nSensitivity,\\n% (95% CI)\\nSpeciﬁcity,\\n% (95% CI)\\nPPV, %\\n(95% CI)\\nAccuracy,\\n% (95% CI)\\nDerivation set (n � 493)\\nIR-1\\n110\\n103\\n51.6\\n97.5\\n94.0\\n77.7\\n7\\n273\\n(45.0–58.3)\\n(94.9–98.8)\\n(88.2–97.1)\\n(73.7–81.1)\\nIR-1’\\n145\\n68\\n68.1\\n91.8\\n86.3\\n81.5\\n23\\n257\\n(61.6–74.0)\\n(88.0–94.5)\\n(80.3–90.7)\\n(77.9–84.7)\\nIR-2\\n186\\n27\\n87.3\\n91.1\\n88.2\\n89.5\\n25\\n255\\n(82.2–91.1)\\n(87.2–93.9)\\n(83.1–91.8)\\n(86.4–91.9)\\nTC-1\\n200\\n13\\n93.9\\n93.6\\n91.7\\n93.7\\n18\\n262\\n(89.8–96.4)\\n(90.1–95.9)\\n(87.3–94.7)\\n(91.2–95.5)\\nValidation set (n � 258)\\nTC-1\\n84\\n4\\n95.5\\n92.9\\n87.5\\n93.8\\n12\\n158\\n(88.9–98.2)\\n(88.1–95.9)\\n(79.4–92.7)\\n(90.2–96.2)\\nTP/FN/FP/TN � True/False Pos/Negative; Sensitivity � Recall, PPV � positive predictive value-precision. 95% conﬁdence intervals are\\ncalculated using the Wilson procedure.\\nJournal of the American Medical Informatics Association\\nVolume 13\\nNumber 6\\nNov / Dec 2006\\n697\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/13/6/696/738083 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nAn additional strength is that the TC-1 algorithm does not\\nrely on domain speciﬁc vocabularies or manual input.\\nInstead, it learns from pre-categorized examples using only\\nsuperﬁcial textual features—which does have as its draw-\\nback that domain experts may need to invest time in labeling\\nexamples.\\nWe believe that the system has proven accurate enough to use\\nin automated decision support for osteoporosis management\\nof wrist fracture patients.

We investigate the potential of machine learning algorithms – Support Vector Machine\\n(SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – to guide rehabilitation planning for home care clients.\\nMethods: This study is a secondary analysis of data on 24,724 longer-term clients from eight home\\ncare programs in Ontario. Data were collected with the RAI-HC assessment system, in which the\\nActivities of Daily Living Clinical Assessment Protocol (ADLCAP) is used to identify clients with\\nrehabilitation potential. For study purposes, a client is defined as having rehabilitation potential if\\nthere was: i) improvement in ADL functioning, or ii) discharge home. SVM and KNN results are\\ncompared with those obtained using the ADLCAP. For comparison, the machine learning\\nalgorithms use the same functional and health status indicators as the ADLCAP.\\nResults: The KNN and SVM algorithms achieved similar substantially improved performance over\\nthe ADLCAP, although false positive and false negative rates were still fairly high (FP > .18, FN >\\n.34 versus FP > .29, FN. > .58 for ADLCAP). Results are used to suggest potential revisions to the\\nADLCAP.\\nConclusion: Machine learning algorithms achieved superior predictions than the current protocol.\\nMachine learning results are less readily interpretable, but can also be used to guide development\\nof improved clinical protocols.\\nBackground\\nTargeting older clients for rehabilitation is a clinical chal-\\nlenge and a research priority [1]. For clients being assessed\\nfor home care services, the decision to provide rehabilita-\\ntion (especially physical or occupational therapy) has\\nmajor implications for the client's future quality of life\\nand independence, as well as major resource implications.\\nThere is considerable evidence of the feasibility and effec-\\ntiveness of rehabilitation in home-based settings [2-5];\\nthere is also evidence that many home care clients who\\nwould benefit from rehabilitation services do not receive\\nthem [6].\\nPublished: 20 December 2007\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\ndoi:10.1186/1472-6947-7-41\\nReceived: 4 September 2007\\nAccepted: 20 December 2007\\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\n© 2007 Zhu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 2 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nResource constraints will inevitably limit the provision of\\nrehabilitation services, but gaps in service also reflect gaps\\nand shortcomings in the management and use of availa-\\nble health information. More appropriate targeting of\\nrehabilitation therapy could be achieved through more\\ninformed care planning, but rehabilitation decisions are\\nparticularly challenging. For acute care patients, diagnoses\\nare often clearly defined. By contrast, rehabilitation\\npatients have considerable variability even within specific\\ndiagnostic categories. Assessment of rehabilitation poten-\\ntial and the potential success of rehabilitation for older\\npatients is not always straightforward, is often compli-\\ncated by medical complexity and multiple co-morbidities\\n[7,8], and requires management by multiple health pro-\\nfessionals in multiple care settings [9]. Our program of\\nresearch is aimed at understanding whether improved\\nclinical decision-making, and ultimately improved client\\noutcomes, could be achieved through more sophisticated\\nuse of routinely collected health assessment information.\\nIn this paper, we are continuing to investigate the poten-\\ntial for machine learning algorithms to guide rehabilita-\\ntion planning for home care clients. Machine learning\\ninvolves computer programs that use experience gained\\nfrom exploration of a dataset to improve performance or\\npredictive ability. These techniques are now being used\\nextensively in biomedical applications [10], for example\\nin predicting the role of genes and proteins. There has\\nbeen less use in support of clinical decision-making and\\nprediction, but these applications are increasing [11,12].\\nThere has been limited investigation of machine learning\\ntechniques in predicting rehabilitation outcomes [13,14].\\nAlthough some of these results have been ambiguous\\n[14], continued exploration in rehabilitation seems war-\\nranted given the importance and challenges of predicting\\nrehabilitation potential or outcomes [1,15,16]. Also, large\\ndatabases are becoming available in rehabilitation set-\\ntings, such as those based on the Functional Independ-\\nence Measure (FIM™, property of Uniform Data System\\nfor Medical Rehabilitation, a division of UB Foundation\\nActivities, Inc) or the interRAI assessment systems [17],\\nthat could be used for this purpose.\\nIn our previous work on the prediction of rehabilitation\\npotential, we applied a simple machine-learning algo-\\nrithm known as the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algo-\\nrithm, which, we argued, resembles clinical logic in that\\npredictions are based on outcomes experienced for similar\\npatients [18]. We found that KNN made significantly bet-\\nter predictions than the clinical assessment protocol – the\\n\"ADLCAP\" – currently in use within the health assessment\\ninformation system used for home care clients in Ontario,\\nCanada and other jurisdictions [19]. In this article, we\\nreport two follow-up studies (Study 1 and Study 2). The\\nresults and insights gained from these studies are then\\nused to inform potential revisions to the ADLCAP, and an\\ninitial assessment of the new method is given.\\nMethods\\nFor both studies reported below, ethics approval was\\nobtained from the Office of Research Ethics at the Univer-\\nsity of Waterloo.\\nStudy 1 Methods. Making predictions with support vector \\nmachines\\nBackground\\nIn our earlier paper [18], we speculated that the support\\nvector machine (SVM, [20]) could potentially improve\\nupon the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm in two\\nways. First, being a state-of-the-art machine-learning algo-\\nrithm and a much more flexible kernel method than\\nKNN, SVM may give more accurate predictions. Second,\\nthe decision rule from SVM will only depend on a subset\\nof observations – called support vectors; these support vec-\\ntors can be regarded as prototypes and, if the total number\\nof support vectors turns out to be small, SVM will produce\\na much more parsimonious and interpretable model.\\nData\\nWe use the same data as used in our earlier report [18]:\\nRAI-HC data from eight Ontario Community Care Access\\nCentres (CCACs, the organizations that coordinate the\\nprovision of home care and long-term care services in the\\nprovince), consisting of 24,724 clients [mean age: 76.3\\n(sd = 13.9); 68.9% female; 15.7% with Alzheimer disease\\nor other dementia]. The true rehabilitation potential (y) of\\nthese clients can be reliably assessed from linked health\\nservice utilization data. For study purposes, a client is\\ndefined as having rehabilitation potential if there was: i)\\nimprovement in ADL functioning, or ii) discharge home.\\nImprovement in ADL functioning was defined as any\\nimprovement in the interRAI ADL Long Form scale\\nderived from the RAI-HC [21], over a follow-up period of\\napproximately one year. The rationale for this definition\\nis that for frail older clients for whom the likely course is\\nfunctional decline, any improvement in ADL functioning\\nis important. Also, persons discharged from home care\\nwho remain in their own homes (i.e., are not admitted to\\na long-term care home) can also be considered to have\\nhad a successful outcome. The interRAI/Minimum Data\\nSet instruments are a comprehensive assessment and\\nproblem identification system developed by an interna-\\ntional consortium of researchers (interRAI). The RAI-HC\\nis mandated for use in all of Ontario's CCACs for all\\nlonger-term clients (approximately 50% of the overall\\nCCAC case load). Repeat assessments are completed at\\nintervals of approximately 180 days. Assessment items\\ninclude: personal items, referral information, diagnoses,\\ncognition, communication and sensory functioning,\\nmood and behavior, physical functioning, continence,\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 3 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nnutrition status, oral health, skin condition, environmen-\\ntal issues, informal support services and service utiliza-\\ntion, and other information. Clinical Assessment\\nProtocols (CAPs) are triggered when specified combina-\\ntions of assessment items indicate that problems or risks\\nare present that warrant intervention or further investiga-\\ntion [19]. The CAP most relevant to rehabilitation plan-\\nning is the Activities of Daily Living Clinical Assessment\\nProtocol, or ADLCAP.\\nIn our earlier work we compared results using the ADL-\\nCAP with results obtained using the KNN machine learn-\\ning algorithm [18]. In order to make conservative and fair\\ncomparisons with the ADLCAP, we used only covariates\\nthat are in the ADLCAP – 19 altogether. Moreover, we also\\ninterpreted these covariates in the same way as the ADL-\\nCAP. For example, the ADLCAP treats the predictor h2a\\n(mobility in bed) in the following way:\\nif h2a = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8 (indicating levels of depend-\\nence);\\nthen consider as dependent;\\nelse (meaning h2a = 0 or 1, indicating independence)\\nconsider as independent.\\nIn other words, suppose that client A has h2a = 2 and cli-\\nent B has h2a = 6. The ADLCAP does not distinguish these\\ntwo clients with regard to h2a. Therefore, we can recode\\nh2a as a binary variable as follows: recode 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and\\n8 as one and recode all other values (0 and 1) as zero.\\nTable 1 summarizes how the covariates are recoded\\naccording to ADLCAP. Also included in Table 1 are the\\npercent of clients in the dataset for whom each covariate\\nis present (% = 1), the chi-square statistic for testing the\\ncorrelation between each covariate and the response, and\\nthe Pearson correlation (corr.) between each covariate and\\nthe response. (Since the response is binary and covariates\\nhere are also recoded as binary, the Pearson correlation is\\nnot exactly the right correlation coefficient to use. The chi-\\nsquare statistic is more commonly used. However, the\\nusual Pearson correlation coefficients are still included\\nhere for the following reason. Since we have a sample size\\nof about 25,000, the chi-square statistics are all very large,\\nreflecting the well-known caveat of classical hypothesis\\ntesting that one can reject any null hypothesis with a large\\nenough sample size. The absolute magnitude of these chi-\\nsquare statistics should not be interpreted in the usual\\nway, but their relative magnitude is still meaningful.)\\nThe Support Vector Machine\\nThe SVM [20] is a prediction algorithm that has received a\\ntremendous amount of attention in the machine learning\\ncommunity during the last decade. Suppose xnew is a vector\\ncontaining all the covariates for a new observation. To\\npredict its outcome, SVM uses quadratic programming to\\nconstruct a model of the following form:\\nwhere w0 and wi are model coefficients; and K(u;v) is a ker-\\nnel function. Once the parameters w0 and wi are estimated,\\nthe final model depends only on a subset of the training\\ndata, denoted above by \"SV\" – they are called support vec-\\ntors and are automatically determined by the SVM algo-\\nrithm. To fit the SVM, we use a library called \"e1071\" in R\\n[22].\\nPerformance Evaluation\\nTo fit an SVM model, we choose the default kernel func-\\ntion, the radial basis kernel. Among the four options pro-\\nvided by the \"e1071\" library – linear, polynomial, radial\\nbasis, and sigmoid – the radial basis kernel is also the\\nmost compatible with a distance-based method such as\\nthe KNN. To use SVM with the radial basis kernel, there\\nare two tuning parameters that we must specify a priori:\\none that controls the width of the kernel function, which\\nwe denote here by γ; and another that essentially controls\\nhow many support vectors the algorithm will ultimately\\nselect, which we denote here by C. The performance of\\nSVM is sensitive to these tuning parameters and the opti-\\nmal value of these parameters are problem-specific.\\nTo determine the best values of these parameters for our\\nproblem and evaluate the final predictive power of SVMs,\\nwe use the same analytic framework as in our earlier study\\n[18]. In particular, we make predictions for the eight\\nCCAC datasets one by one. For example, when making\\npredictions for region 1, we randomly sample 2500 obser-\\nvations from regions 2–8 and use them as the training set\\nfor building the SVM. Tuning parameters are selected by\\nperforming 5-fold cross-validation on the training set\\nalone using the overall error rate as the guiding criterion.\\nData from region 1 are not used to build the SVM or select\\nthe tuning parameters. This procedure guarantees that our\\nSVMs do not use any information from the data they are\\nabout to predict, so their predictive performances can be\\nfairly evaluated.\\nSince we construct and use different training sets to make\\npredictions for different regions, we have a total of eight\\ndifferent training sets. After performing cross-validation\\non each of them, eight slightly different sets of optimal\\ntuning parameters are obtained. They turn out to be quite\\nclose to each other. Generally, the optimal parameters are\\naround γ = 0.06 and C = 0.24.\\nf x\\nw\\nw K x\\nx\\nnew\\ni\\nnew\\ni\\nx\\nSV\\ni\\n(\\n)\\n;\\n,\\n=\\n+\\n(\\n)\\n∈∑\\n0\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 4 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nPrediction accuracy is then evaluated using exactly the\\nsame four criteria as in [18], namely, the false positive\\n(false+) and false negative (false-) rates, and the positive\\nand negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR+ and DLR-\\n).\\nStudy 2 Methods. Relaxation of covariates\\nBackground\\nWe have pointed out that the ADLCAP seemed to inter-\\npret the covariates in a rather restrictive manner [18].

Again, we do this with cross-vali-\\ndation. The parameters chosen are: K = 20, C = 1.25, and\\nγ = 0.01.\\nResults\\nStudy 1 Results. Making predictions with support vector \\nmachines\\nContrary to our speculations [18], we find that, for this\\nparticular problem, SVM does not offer a statistically sig-\\nnificant improvement over KNN in terms of prediction\\naccuracy (Table 2). In addition, about 75% of the obser-\\nvations are selected by SVM as support vectors. Hence,\\nthere is hardly any gain in terms of parsimony or inter-\\npretability.\\nHowever, this does not mean that SVM is completely use-\\nless for our problem. In SVM, observations chosen as sup-\\nport vectors are either very close to or on the wrong side\\nof the decision boundary. Non-support vectors, on the\\nother hand, are on the correct side of the boundary and at\\nleast a certain distance away from it; they are the easy-to-\\nclassify observations in the dataset [20]. In our context,\\nthese are clients that, according to SVM, either clearly have\\nor clearly do not have any rehabilitation potential. A care-\\nful examination of these two groups of clients, therefore,\\ncan yield additional insights.\\nWe build an SVM with a random sample of 10,000 obser-\\nvations from all eight CCAC datasets and examine the\\nresulting two groups of support vectors. In Table 3, each\\nrow shows the fraction of observations in each of these\\ntwo group whose corresponding covariate is equal to 1 –\\nrecall from Table 1 that all covariates had been recoded in\\nour study to be binary. It is evident from Table 3, that\\nthese two groups of clients are most different in terms of\\nh2j, h7a, and h7c, which suggests that they are the most\\nimportant variables for predicting rehabilitation poten-\\ntial.\\nWe then perform a slightly different analysis to verify this\\nresult. Recall that, along our earlier analyses, we have cre-\\nated eight different training datasets, each consisting of\\n2500 observations. On each of these eight datasets, we\\nperform stepwise variable selection on a standard logistic\\nregression model using the Akaike Information Criterion\\n(AIC) as the selection criterion. This is done with the func-\\ntions \"glm\" and \"stepAIC\" in R [22]. We thus obtain eight\\nslightly different subsets of selected variables. The only\\nvariables that appear in the intersection of all eight subsets\\nare h2j – independent in bathing, h7a – client optimistic\\nabout functional improvement, and h7c – client rated as\\nhaving good prospects of recovery.\\nSummary\\nLike KNN, SVM predicts rehabilitation potential better\\nthan the ADLCAP, but there is little statistical difference\\nbetween KNN and SVM. Analysis using the SVM reveals\\nthat the most important variables for predicting rehabili-\\ntation potential are h2j – independent in bathing, h7a –\\nclient optimistic about functional improvement, and h7c\\n– client rated as having good prospect of recovery.\\nStudy 2 Results. Relaxation of Covariates\\nThe Study 2 results are peculiar and at first counter-intui-\\ntive. When the original scales are used, SVM performs\\nslightly better but KNN performs slightly worse than\\nbefore (Tables 4 and 5).\\nTable 2: Prediction performance of various algorithms. \"CAP\" refers to the ADLCAP.

The analysis that provides us with an insight into this\\npeculiarity is described below. The insight gained from\\nthis analysis not only resolves this mystery for us; it also\\nsuggests a new method of defining the ADLCAP.\\nTake the covariate h2a for example. Using all the data, we\\ncan estimate the following ratio:\\nIf \\n > 1, this means it is more likely for those with reha-\\nbilitation potential to score a zero on item h2a. Likewise,\\nif \\n < 1, it means it is more likely for those without\\nrehabilitation potential to score a zero on this item.\\nCall \\n the (likelihood) ratio profile of h2a.\\nFor the sake of argument, suppose the ratio profile of h2a\\nlooks like this: {5, 4, 3, 2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1}. Such a profile\\nwould mean that clients with rehabilitation potential are 5\\ntimes more likely than those without potential to score a 0\\non item h2a, 4 times more likely to score a 1, 3 times more\\nlikely to score a 2, and 2 times more likely to score a 3. On\\nthe other hand, clients without rehabilitation potential are\\n10 times more likely to score a 6, 5 times more likely to\\nscore a 5 and 2 times more likely to score a 4.\\nBased on such a profile, how would one use h2a (alone)\\nto predict rehabilitation potential y ? The obvious answer\\nis as follows:\\nor\\nNow, define the ratio profile score for h2a as\\nIn the hypothetical illustration above, we would have Sh2a\\n= 5 ÷ (0.5) = 10. This score can be treated as a rough meas-\\nure of how accurately one can predict rehabilitation\\npotential using the covariate h2a. The higher the score, the\\nbetter.\\nFigure 1 shows the ratio profiles of all 19 covariates\\ntogether with their corresponding ratio profile scores; the\\nhorizontal line in each profile plot is the critical line at\\nwhich the ratio is equal to 1. We can make the following\\nobservations:\\n1. The three covariates with the highest ratio profile scores\\nare: h7c – good prospect of recovery (Sh7c = 4.14), h2j –\\nbathing (Sh2j = 3.12), and h7a – client optimistic about\\nfunctional improvement (Sh7a = 3.01). This is, again, in\\nexact agreement with our results from Study 1.\\n2. The covariates h7c and h7a are not affected whether we\\nuse the original scale or not (see Figure 1).\\n3. Based on the ratio profile of h2j, the best way to use h2j\\nfor prediction is as follows: \\n = 1 if h2 j = 0, 1; \\n = 0 if h2\\nj = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That is, for h2j, the recoded scale is actually\\nthe best, better than the original scale which uses more\\ninformation on levels of impairment. Using the original\\nscale turns out to only add extra noise to our underlying\\nprediction problem.\\n4. For covariates in the h2* category (h2a – h2j), h2i has\\nthe second highest score (Sh2i = 1.41). Based on its ratio\\nprofile, the best way to use h2i for prediction is as follows:\\n = 1 if h2i = 0 ; \\n = 0 if h2i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That is, for\\nh2i, the recoded scale is almost the best. It would have\\nbeen better to separate 0 from 1–6 rather than grouping 0\\nand 1 together (see Figure 1). In fact, the same can be said\\nabout most other covariates in the h2* category – except\\nh2d. For these covariates, using the original scale adds\\nsome extra noise, but it also introduces the opportunity\\nfor an algorithm to use these covariates in a more optimal\\nway.\\n5. The ratio profiles of c3 and p6 indicate that the recoded\\nscales severely mask the information contained in these\\ncovariates for predicting rehabilitation potential. There is\\nextra information in the original scale. In both cases, it\\nwould have been better to recode \"0\" into \"0\" and every-\\nthing else into \"1\".\\nThese observations suggest that there is a tradeoff between\\nusing the original and the recoded scales. On the one\\nhand, there is some extra information useful for predic-\\ntion if the original scales are used.

Generally speaking, it would have been better\\nto define the ratio profile score (for covariate x) as\\nHowever, it can easily be seen from Figure 1 that, for most\\ncovariates in our dataset, there is only one ratio above the\\ncritical threshold of one. For these covariates, the two ver-\\nsions of the ratio profile scores are identical, that is, \\n =\\nSx. The only exceptions are: h2d and h2j. In the case of\\nh2d, Figure 1 shows that the two bars above the critical\\nthreshold \\nare \\nof \\nsimilar \\nheights, \\ni.e.,\\n. So we expect\\n to be very close to Sh2d as well, and it does not matter\\nvery much which one is used in practice. For h2j, however,\\nit is clear from Figure 1 that \\n is much\\nsmaller than \\n, which means h2j\\nwould have had a much lower score had we used the more\\ngeneral definition, \\n. But it is also clear from Figure 1\\nthat h2j is actually one of the stronger predictive variables,\\nand using the more general definition would have\\nseverely understated its true predictive power. Based on\\nthese considerations, we chose to use a definition that is\\nnot completely general but more suitable for our specific\\npurposes here.\\nTo explain the peculiar and counter-intuitive results in\\nTables 4 and 5, we conjecture that KNN has suffered more\\nthan benefited from this particular tradeoff, whereas SVM,\\nbeing a more sophisticated and robust algorithm, has\\nbenefited more than suffered from it. This conjecture is\\nconfirmed by simulation experiments, which we describe\\nin the Appendix.\\nSummary and new method of defining ADLCAP\\nThe peculiar results from applying KNN and SVM to the\\n\"relaxed datasets\" have led us to carry out an in-depth\\ninvestigation. As a result, we are able to gain significant\\nnew insight into the nature of the problem. We find that\\nthe implicit recoding of the covariates by the ADLCAP\\n(Table 1) is, generally speaking, quite reasonable; it is\\nclose to being optimal for the most influential covariates.\\nMore importantly, however, our investigation suggests a\\nnew method of defining the ADLCAP, one that is based\\non an analysis of the covariates' (likelihood) ratio profiles\\n(Figure 1).\\nFigure 1 contains rich information. Take the covariate c3\\nfor an example. The bar at c3 = 0 is higher than the critical\\nhorizontal line with height 1. This means that, if c3 = 0, it\\nis more likely that the client has rehabilitation potential.\\nOn the other hand, the bars at c3 = 1, 2, 3, 4 are all lower\\nthan the critical line. This means if c3 = 1, 2, 3, 4, it is more\\nlikely that the client does not have rehabilitation poten-\\ntial. Clearly, such information can be used to make predic-\\ntions. It is also clear from Figure 1 that the information\\ncontained in the ratio profile of c3 is not as good as that\\ncontained in the ratio profile of, say h7c, because h7c has\\na much higher ratio profile score (4.14 versus 1.49). Thus,\\ndecisions based on different covariates should be\\nweighted accordingly. An alternative ADLCAP based on\\nthis argument is outlined in Table 6.\\nThe use of threshold = 15.8 in Table 6 is somewhat arbi-\\ntrary; it is only selected so that we can make an initial\\nassessment. On the eight CCAC datasets (n = 24,724), the\\nADLCAP is triggered for 8,913 clients, i.e., about 36.05%.\\nTo allow us to make a fair comparison, we reason back-\\nwards by asking: what would the threshold have to be so\\nthat 36.05% of all the clients would score above this\\nthreshold value on the alternative ADLCAP as well? The\\nanswer turns out to be 15.8.

If informa-\\ntion systems are used to ensure appropriate and equitable\\naccess to rehabilitation services, there will be major bene-\\nfits to the health, quality of life and independence of reha-\\nbilitation clients. There will also be major health system\\nbenefits through decreased costs, more appropriate\\nresource use, and avoided institutional placements.\\nIn the first study reported here, we found that the support\\nvector machine (SVM) predicts rehabilitation potential\\nbetter than the ADLCAP, but there is little statistical differ-\\nence between SVM and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN)\\nalgorithm [18]. In addition, the SVM did not really give a\\nmore parsimonious model. Using the SVM, however, we\\nwere able to find that the most important predictors for\\nthis particular prediction task are dependence in bathing\\n(h2j), the client being optimistic about functional\\nimprovement (h7a), and good prospects of recovery from\\ncurrent conditions (h7c). In the second study, we found\\nthat the implicit recoding of the covariates by the ADLCAP\\n(Table 1) is generally quite reasonable, especially for the\\nmost important predictors. We then described a simple\\nanalysis based on the covariates' (likelihood) ratio pro-\\nfiles and showed that such an analysis can lead to a new\\nmethod of defining the ADLCAP. Our initial assessment\\nshowed that the alternative ADLCAP thus defined is capa-\\nble of producing predictions that are competitive against\\nthe machine learning algorithms we have experimented\\nwith so far.\\nWe believe our work to date supports continued investiga-\\ntion of the potential for advanced statistical techniques,\\nincluding machine learning algorithms, to support care\\nplanning for rehabilitation. Both of the machine learning\\ntechniques we have explored, the KNN and SVM algo-\\nrithms, have achieved substantially improved perform-\\nance over a currently used clinical protocol. Reservations\\nabout the use of these methods include the interpretabil-\\nity of their results, and the resulting potential for clinical\\nresistance to a \"black box\" approach. For this reason we\\nhave so far chosen methods that could be seen as analo-\\ngous to clinical reasoning (KNN) or that could identify\\nprototypical cases that could aid interpretation (SVM). In\\naddition to improved statistical prediction, our work\\npoints to an additional, and possibly more important,\\nbenefit of these methods. Our analyses of the machine\\nlearning results have provided insights into the factors\\nthat may be most influential in predicting rehabilitation\\npotential – \"the contents of the black box\" – and also into\\noptimal ways to categorize these variables (i.e., to define\\nclinical cutpoints). We have also shown how these results\\ncould be used to redefine the clinical protocol to achieve\\nresults similar to that achieved using machine learning\\nalgorithms.\\nConclusion\\nMachine learning algorithms achieved superior predic-\\ntions than the current protocol, although the results are\\nless readily interpretable. We recognize that targeting cli-\\nents for rehabilitation remains a challenge, and any man-\\nageable health information system will be limited in its\\nability to predict rehabilitation potential. We suggest\\nhowever that we have illustrated how machine learning\\ntechniques can \"set the bar\" for clinical predictions, and\\nalso how machine learning can be used to refine clinical\\nprotocols to achieve comparable performance.\\nCompeting interests\\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing\\ninterests.\\nTable 7: Comparison of prediction performances. \"OLD\" = the original ADLCAP, same as [18] and Table 2; \"SVM\" = SVM using \\nrelaxed dataset, same as Table 5, column \"New\"; \"NEW\" = alternative ADLCAP (Table 6).\\nOverall Error\\nFalse +\\nFalse -\\nDLR +\\nDLR -\\nRegio\\nn\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\nOLD\\nSVM\\nNEW\\n1\\n0.37\\n0.34\\n0.36\\n0.30\\n0.34\\n0.36\\n0.65\\n0.33\\n0.37\\n1.18\\n1.97\\n1.75\\n0.92\\n0.50\\n0.58\\n2\\n0.37\\n0.30\\n0.30\\n0.31\\n0.26\\n0.25\\n0.62\\n0.42\\n0.48\\n1.24\\n2.20\\n2.10\\n0.89\\n0.57\\n0.64\\n3\\n0.38\\n0.34\\n0.32\\n0.32\\n0.33\\n0.28\\n0.63\\n0.42\\n0.50\\n1.14\\n1.77\\n1.79\\n0.93\\n0.63\\n0.69\\n4\\n0.46\\n0.31\\n0.34\\n0.36\\n0.28\\n0.31\\n0.65\\n0.37\\n0.39\\n0.99\\n2.24\\n1.99\\n1.00\\n0.51\\n0.56\\n5\\n0.31\\n0.23\\n0.20\\n0.27\\n0.20\\n0.16\\n0.67\\n0.45\\n0.52\\n1.25\\n2.69\\n3.05\\n0.91\\n0.57\\n0.62\\n6\\n0.43\\n0.29\\n0.27\\n0.38\\n0.26\\n0.22\\n0.62\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n1.01\\n2.36\\n2.53\\n1.00\\n0.53\\n0.58\\n7\\n0.48\\n0.31\\n0.32\\n0.43\\n0.29\\n0.29\\n0.59\\n0.35\\n0.38\\n0.95\\n2.23\\n2.17\\n1.04\\n0.49\\n0.53\\n8\\n0.42\\n0.32\\n0.29\\n0.37\\n0.30\\n0.23\\n0.62\\n0.38\\n0.49\\n1.03\\n2.04\\n2.16\\n0.98\\n0.55\\n0.64\\nMean\\n0.40\\n0.30\\n0.30\\n0.34\\n0.28\\n0.26\\n0.63\\n0.39\\n0.45\\n1.10\\n2.19\\n2.19\\n0.96\\n0.54\\n0.61\\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:41\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/41\\nPage 11 of 13\\n(page number not for citation purposes)\\nAuthors' contributions\\nMZ, JPH and PS all participated in the conceptualization\\nand design of the study.

In\\neach experiment, we first generate a training sample of\\n1250 observations, each with two predictors (x1, x2) and a\\nbinary outcome y. The first 1000 samples belong to one\\nclass (y = 0) and the remaining 250 belong to the other\\n(y = 1). The two predictors are generated independently\\nusing probability distributions specified in Table 8. Then,\\nan independent test sample of 1250 observations are gen-\\nerated using exactly the same mechanism.\\nThe predictor x1 is designed to mimic the behavior of h2j,\\nwhereas the predictor x2 is designed to mimic the behavior\\nof a typical h2* covariate such as h2i. In particular, for x1,\\nwe have \\n = 4 > 1 and \\n < 1 for all j = 2, 3, 4, 5,\\n6. That is, just like h2j, the recoded scale is optimal for x1.\\nFor x2, we have \\n = 2 > 1 and \\n < 1 for all j = 1, 2, 3,\\n4, 5, 6. That is, just like most of the h2* covariates, the\\nrecoded scale is close to being optimal for x2, but it would\\nhave been better to separate 0 from 1–6 rather than group-\\ning 0 and 1 together (Table 8). The correct decision is to\\npredict \\n = 1 if and only if (x1, x2) = (0, 0) or (1, 0).\\nThe true decision surface is shown in Figure 2. The distri-\\nbutions of (x1, x2) are deliberately made somewhat noisy\\nand irregular for x1 ≥ 2 and x2 ≥ 1. As a result, we can see\\nthat there is a small but noticeable bump in the true deci-\\nsion surface around (x1, x2) = (0, 4) and (1, 4) (Figure 2).\\nThis will increase the chance for data-driven algorithms to\\nmake mistakes in this region.\\nWe then fit a KNN and an SVM model on the training\\nsample and use them to predict the test sample. We do\\nthis once with the predictors (x1, x2) in their original scale\\nand once with the predictors recoded according to Table 1\\nas if they were h2j and h2i.\\nThe overall error rates of KNN and SVM from the 10 sim-\\nulations are shown using boxplots in Figure 3. The per-\\nformances of KNN and SVM are almost identical when\\napplied to the recoded variables, but when applied to the\\noriginal variables, SVM performs slightly better whereas\\nKNN performs slightly worse.\\nFigure 4 gives more insight into why this is the case.

It is also clear that, when the original\\nscales are used, KNN is more likely than SVM to be\\n\"fooled\" by the extra bump near (x1, x2) = (0, 4). In addi-\\ntion, when the original scales are used, SVM can be seen\\nto have a much better chance of making the correct predic-\\ntion of \\n = 0 at (x1, x2) = (1, 1).\\nFinally, it is worth noting that there is considerable noise\\nin our simulated data. Even if we used the true underlying\\ndecision surface (Figure 2) to make predictions, we would\\nstill make considerable misclassification error. Therefore,\\na high error rate alone should not be taken as an indica-\\ntion that algorithms such as KNN and SVM are perform-\\ning poorly. In this case, it is rather an indication that the\\nunderlying data are very noisy. In fact, the decision surface\\nestimated by SVM (Figure 4) in this simulation was not far\\nfrom the true decision surface (Figure 2).\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis study was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health \\nResearch Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis.\\nReferences\\n1.\\nStolee P, Borrie MJ, Cook S, Hollomby J, the participants of the Cana-\\ndian Consensus Workshop on Geriatric Rehabilitation: A research\\nagenda for geriatric rehabilitation: The Canadian consensus.\\nGeriatr Today: J Can Geriatr Soc 2004, 7:38-42.\\n2.\\nGiusti A, Barone A, Oliveri M, Pizzonia M, Razzano M, Palummari E,\\nPioli G: An analysis of the feasibility of home rehabilitation\\namong elderly people with proximal femoral fractures.

While the use of \\nfree text facilitates rapid and relatively convenient data entry, using predefined codes \\ncan enhance EHR retrieval, mining, and analysis, and may improve communication \\nbetween care givers [2]. Most EHR implementations therefore rely on both methods.  \\nOften, both free text and coded fields are available for storing a particular data type, \\nenabling clinicians to input potentially contradictory data [3,4]. Discordance between \\ndata in the EHR may lead to confusion and mistakes in patient care [4] and may result \\nin spurious conclusions of applications that utilize EHR data. Identifying discordances \\nbetween free text and coded fields is a challenging task, and typically requires \\nextensive work by a domain expert [3, 4].  \\nHere we present a method to automatically identify inconsistencies between free \\ntext and associated coded fields in EHRs. In short, our method works by predicting the \\nmost expected code, based on the available free text data, and highlighting cases where \\nthis prediction is different from the actual code selected by the clinician. Specifically, \\n                                                           \\n1 Corresponding Author: Ruty Rinott, E-mail: rutyr@il.ibm.com.  65 Aba Hushi st., Haifa 31905, Israel  \\n \\nQuality of Life through Quality of Information\\nJ.

We then use \\nthe obtained classifiers to predict the code based on the free text. Cases for which all \\nclassifiers predict the same code, while the clinician has selected a different code, are \\nmarked as potential inconsistencies. We report encouraging results over a real world \\ndataset of 734 discharge letters of Sarcoma patients that supports the validity of our \\nproposed strategy.  \\n1. Materials & Methods  \\nData. We demonstrate our methodology over anonymized discharge letters of Soft \\nTissue Sarcoma patients treated at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori \\n(INT) between 2006 and 2011.  The letters are stored using the CDA standard as \\ndefined by the Lombardy Oncology Network and contain both free text and coded \\nfields. The data includes 734 discharge letters, termed \"documents\" that span 456 \\ntreatment programs. We identified 5 coded fields that capture information which is also \\ndescribed to some extent in free text fields, as described in Table 1. Each row in Table \\n1 represents a separate inconsistency detection task, handled using the methods \\ndescribed below. \\nTable 1.

For each task we define the data (X) and labels (Y). X is \\ncreated from free text data, using the Bag Of Words (BOW) model [6]. Specifically, \\nthe data is represented by a matrix where the rows correspond to documents and the \\ncolumns correspond to words appearing in the documents. Here we use the “sign” \\nversion of the BOW model, where Xij=1 if word j appears in the relevant text fields of \\ndocument i, and 0 otherwise. For tasks that involve multiple free text fields, we \\nconsider in which field the word appeared. Thus, if the word j appears in k different \\nfree text fields, we represent it by k features. Tokenizing and stemming was done using \\nLucene Italian Analyzer [7]. The labels, Y, are defined via the codes appearing in the \\nrelevant coded field. For two of the tasks, TP and Presentation, there was not enough \\ninformation in the free text to properly train a classifier that will be able to differentiate \\nbetween all codes. Hence, for these tasks, we used domain knowledge to aggregate the \\ncodes into a smaller set of high-level codes, which we used as labels.  \\nR. Rinott et al. / Automatic Detection of Inconsistencies Between Free Text and Coded Data\\n662\\nClassification Algorithms. To reduce the number of falsely reported \\ninconsistencies we used an ensemble of classifiers for each task [5]. We selected three \\nclassifiers which use diverse classification approaches, do not require tuning of many \\nparameters, and provide a confidence associated with the prediction: Naïve Bayes (NB) \\n[8], K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) [9], and Multi-class Decision Tree (MDT) [10]. We \\nused the Matlab implementation of NB and MDT, with the posterior probability of the \\nmost probable class (MAP) as the confidence estimation. For the KNN classifier we \\nused Cosine similarity over the TF-IDF BOW matrix [6], with k=7. Confidence was \\ndefined as the percent of neighbors agreeing with the predicted label, weighted by their \\nsimilarity to the query instance. For each classifier, we also estimated the confidence \\nthat the code selected by the clinician is inconsistent (termed inconsistency confidence), \\ncalculated as one minus the probability associated with the code chosen by the clinician. \\nThe classifiers were trained using the leave-one-out scheme: for every document, we \\ntrained the classifiers using all other documents, and then used the classifier to predict \\nthe document's code, and estimate the prediction and inconsistency confidence.  \\nLearning in the presence of noisy labels. Unlike conventional classification \\nsettings that assume that the labels of the training data are all correct, here, we assume \\nthat the data contains inconsistencies, implying that for some instance in the training \\nset, the label (i.e., code) provided by the clinician is incorrect. These mislabeled \\ninstances may decrease the prediction accuracy of the classifiers, even if they occur in a \\nsmall fraction of the data [11]. To alleviate this problem we removed from the training \\ndata instances which are highly suspected as being mislabeled, using a method \\nreminiscent to that suggested in [11]. Namely, after the first round of training and \\nclassification, we removed from the training data all instances for which all three \\nclassifiers predicted with high confidence a code different from that selected by the \\nclinician. The confidence threshold was chosen for each classifier so that at most 20% \\nof the data is considered mislabeled. We then repeated the training process, using the \\nfiltered training data. These classifiers are used to predict the label and confidence for \\nall the documents (including those removed in the first step). \\n2. Results \\n2.1. Classification results \\nWe first estimated our classifiers performance by comparing their predictions with the \\nclinicians' choice. Admittedly, this is not a perfect measure, since some of the observed \\ndisagreements reflect a mistake made by the clinician. Nonetheless, as we assume that \\ninconsistencies are relatively rare in the data, this seems like an initial reasonable \\nmeasure.  Table 2 summarizes these results for all tasks in terms of micro-averaged \\nrecall and precision [12].  \\nTable 2. Micro-averaged recall and precision for each task. The first column refers to results of the classifier \\nthat achieved the highest precision (mentioned in parenthesis). The last two refer to the ensemble. \\nCoded Field\\n \\n Precision best method\\n \\nPrecision ensemble\\n \\nRecall ensemble\\n \\nPresentation\\n \\n0.95 (DT)\\n \\n0.98\\n \\n0.77\\n \\nICDO-T \\n \\n0.74 (NB)\\n \\n0.93\\n \\n0.54\\n \\nICDO-M \\n \\n0.91 (DT)\\n \\n0.96\\n \\n0.73\\n \\nTreatment program\\n \\n0.59 (NB)\\n \\n0.64\\n \\n0.34\\n \\n RECIST\\n \\n0.60 (DT)\\n \\n0.83\\n \\n0.36\\n \\nR. Rinott et al. / Automatic Detection of Inconsistencies Between Free Text and Coded Data\\n663\\nWhen evaluating the performance of the ensemble method we considered only \\ninstances for which all classifiers predicted the same label, which lead to higher \\nprecision, at the cost of reduction in recall. \\n2.2. Manual validation of identified inconsistencies \\nFor each task, we marked as potentially inconsistent cases in which all classifiers \\nagreed on a code which was different than that chosen by the clinician. These records \\nwere then examined by expert oncologists from INT and classified into one of three \\noptions: (i) true inconsistency; (ii) false inconsistency (method error); (iii) not enough \\ninformation to determine. In addition, in the three tasks for which we did not aggregate \\nthe codes, the classifiers prediction can further serve as a suggestion for the correct \\ncode. For these tasks the domain experts determined if the predicted code is indeed the \\ncorrect code. The results are summarized in Table 3. To further improve the precision \\nof our method, we can mark as potentially inconsistent only cases for which the \\naverage inconsistency confidence of the classifiers is high. In theory, this requires \\nlearning a confidence threshold for each task. In practice, since our data is relatively \\nsmall, learning such a threshold may result in over fitting the data. However, to \\ndemonstrate the utility of using the inconsistency confidence, we report the percent of \\ncases correctly predicted as inconsistent when examining only the top 50% cases, \\nranked according to confidence. As indicated by the last column of Table 3, this \\nimproves the precision of our method for most tasks, in some cases by a factor of 2.5. \\nThe fairly high variance in the precision of our method for different tasks is not \\nsurprising, as the complexity of the different free text fields - and their correlation with \\nthe codified field data - highly differs from task to task. An extreme example is \\npredicting the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) code from the \\nclinical summary field. This is a very general field clinicians use to summarize \\ndifferent aspects of the patients hospitalization episode, and sometimes contains little \\nor no information regarding the tumor's response, as reflected by the large fraction of \\ncases for which there was not enough information to determine if the code is consistent.  \\nTable 3.

Inspection of the data reveals that there are 26 cases \\nfor which the diagnosis according to the free text was Fibromyxosarcoma. For 20 of \\nthese, the ICDO-M code selected by the clinician was “Malignant fibrous \\nhistiocytoma” while for the remaining 6, the selected code was “Sarcoma, not \\notherwise specified (NOS)”. The ROL version used at the time the data was collected \\ndid not contain a specific code for Fibromyxosarcoma, and thus the clinicians should \\nhave chosen the general “Sarcoma, NOS” code. Since most clinicians chose the same \\nincorrect code, our classifier learned from that mistake, and marked the cases in which \\n“Sarcoma, NOS” was (properly) chosen as inconsistent. This demonstrates that cases in \\nR. Rinott et al. / Automatic Detection of Inconsistencies Between Free Text and Coded Data\\n664\\nwhich clinicians repeatedly make the same mistake pose a challenge to our method. \\nHowever, we believe that such cases are rare, and will usually occur when there is a \\nlacking or ill-defined code. In such cases, as this example shows, our method highlights \\na potential problem, although it does not identify the inconsistent cases correctly. \\nIndeed, in the current ROL version, a new code for Fibromyxosarcoma was added.  \\n3. Discussion \\nIn spite of advances in development and standardization of ontologies and \\nterminologies, the use of free text in EHR is still very common and will probably \\nremain so in the near future. This raises the need for automatic detection of \\ndiscordances in EHR, using the free text information. Here we presented an automatic \\nmethod to detect inconsistencies between free text and coded fields in clinical data and \\ndemonstrated its validity over clinical discharge summaries of STS patients.  \\nSeveral directions can be pursued to improve the accuracy of our method. First, \\ngiven a larger EHR dataset will probably increase the precision of the examined \\nclassifiers, and will further allow considering more advanced classification schemes. \\nSecond, much progress can be made in the free text representation. Here we used the \\nBOW model which has the advantage of simplicity, but loses much information such as \\nnegation and factuality level. Advancing beyond BOW representations certainly merits \\nfurther investigation. \\nHere we used our method to retrospectively examine clinical records. A valuable \\nfuture implementation is in online detection, drawing the clinician’s attention to \\ninconsistencies while she is filling the record. Furthermore, our method shows \\npromising results in terms of predicting the correct code from the free text fields.  This \\nability can be used to suggest the correct code for the clinician, facilitating and \\naccelerating data entry process. However, this must be done with caution, and only in \\ncases where the prediction precision is extremely high, to avoid encouraging repeating \\nmistakes.  \\nReferences \\n[1] \\nHersh WR, Hickam DH, Leone TJ.

biomarker changes. In order to evaluate the usability of protein biomarkers for pre-\\nscreening purposes several different approaches were used, including machine learning algorithms.\\nMethods: All persons involved in the study had diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was diagnosed by capturing 7-\\nfield fundus images, evaluated by two independent ophthalmologists. 165 eyes were examined (from 119 patients),\\n55 were diagnosed healthy and 110 images showed signs of DR. Tear samples were taken from all eyes and state-\\nof-the-art nano-HPLC coupled ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry protein identification was performed on all samples.\\nApplicability of protein biomarkers was evaluated by six different optimally parameterized machine learning\\nalgorithms: Support Vector Machine, Recursive Partitioning, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression,\\nK-Nearest Neighbor.\\nResults: Out of the six investigated machine learning algorithms the result of Recursive Partitioning proved to be\\nthe most accurate. The performance of the system realizing the above algorithm reached 74% sensitivity and 48%\\nspecificity.\\nConclusions: Protein biomarkers selected and classified with machine learning algorithms alone are at present not\\nrecommended for screening purposes because of low specificity and sensitivity values.

The initially latent disease could\\nlead to vision loss without any symptoms initially. Timely\\ndiagnosis and therapy however can significantly decelerate\\nits progress, necessitating regular DR screening or appro-\\npriate follow-up in all patients with diabetes. Screening\\ncan be carried out by direct and indirect ophthalmology\\nor increasingly by using photographic methods [2].\\nThe effectiveness of different screening modalities has\\nbeen widely investigated. UK studies show sensitivity\\nlevels for the detection of sight-threatening diabetic ret-\\ninopathy of 41-67% for general practitioners, 48-82% for\\noptometrists, 65% for ophthalmologists, and 27-67% for\\ndiabetologists and hospital physicians using direct oph-\\nthalmoscopy [3,4]. Sensitivity for the detection of refer-\\nable retinopathy by optometrists have been found to be\\n77-100%, with specificity of 94-100% [5].\\nPhotographic methods currently use digital images\\nwith subsequent grading by trained individuals.

The British Diabetic As-\\nsociation (Diabetes UK) has established standard values\\nfor any diabetic retinopathy screening programme of at\\nleast 80% sensitivity and 95% specificity [7,8].\\nRegular DR screening is centralized in several developed\\ncountries due to cost-efficiency and quality control issues\\n[9]. Digital fundus images are captured at the place of pa-\\ntient care and forwarded to a grading center for evaluation\\nby specially trained human graders or ophthalmologists\\n[10]. The system operates with high accuracy but due to\\nits labor intensive nature, it might be poorly scalable in\\neconomically challenged countries [11].\\nIn order to improve scalability and cost-effectiveness,\\nmany research groups are working on developing auto-\\nmated image analysis technologies [12]. Introducing\\nthese technologies in DR screening could substitute first\\nphase examinations performed by human graders. Fol-\\nlowing automated pre-screening, human graders would\\nonly have to examine images that are either questionable\\nor true positive, and potentially carry out quality control\\non a subset of those deemed normal by the software\\n[13]. Preliminary results are promising, sensitivity and\\nspecificity indicators of automated systems are close to\\nthat of human graders [14-16]. An international Retin-\\nopathy Online Challenge is available in order to compare\\nthe results of image processing based algorithms for DR\\nidentification via mycroaneurism detection. The system\\ndeveloped by our team currently performs the best on\\nthis challenge [17].\\nThe aim of this paper is to describe a pilot study,\\nconducted as a first attempt to examine the use of tear\\nfluid proteomics for DR pre-screening. Our hypothesis\\nwas that it is possible to categorize patients with un-\\nknown clinical status into a DR or a non-DR group,\\nbased on the protein pattern identified in the tear fluid\\nsample.\\nTear fluid proteomics\\nBesides computer based image processing other methods\\ncan also support DR screening. Tear fluid proteomics is\\nsuch a possible novel tool for population screening,\\nwhich is based on the pre-screening of a large number\\nof patients and uses human graders only in positive or\\nambiguous cases. The protein composition of tear fluid\\nhas been investigated by numerous research groups and\\nmore than 500 proteins are already proven to be present\\nthere [18,19]. Reports confirm protein profile changes in\\ntear fluid under irregular physiological and pathological\\nconditions (like wound healing or inflammatory diseases\\netc.) [20]. Besides the proteins secreted by the lacrimal\\nglands, tear fluid might contain proteins from epithelial\\ncells covering the eye surface. Furthermore proteins nor-\\nmally residing in the blood can get into the tear fluid\\nthrough increased permeability of the conjunctival ves-\\nsels [21].\\nPhysiological and pathological conditions of the retina\\nalso induce changes in the protein composition of the vit-\\nreous humour, especially when the blood-retinal barrier\\n(BRB) is damaged [22]. Breakdown of the inner endothe-\\nlial BRB, occurs in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macu-\\nlar degeneration, retinal vein occlusions, uveitis and other\\nchronic retinal diseases [23]. DR is a complex disease,\\ncharacterized by vascular alterations, inflammation, and\\nneuronal cell death that involve heat-shock and crystalline\\nproteins. The central mechanism of altered BRB function\\nis a change in the permeability characteristics of retinal\\nendothelial cells caused by elevated levels of growth fac-\\ntors, cytokines, advanced glycation end products, inflam-\\nmation, hyperglycemia and loss of pericytes. Subsequently,\\nparacellular but also transcellular transport across the ret-\\ninal vascular wall increases via opening of endothelial\\nintercellular junctions and qualitative and quantitative\\nchanges in endothelial caveolar transcellular transport, re-\\nspectively. Functional changes in pericytes and astrocytes,\\nas well as structural changes in the composition of the\\nendothelial glycocalyx and the basal lamina around BRB\\nendothelium further facilitate BRB leakage. As Starling's\\nrules apply, active transcellular transport of plasma pro-\\nteins by the BRB endothelial cells causing increased inter-\\nstitial osmotic pressure is probably the main factor in the\\nformation of macular edema [23]. Recent studies using\\nwhole proteome analysis demonstrate that general stress\\nresponse lead to the induction of heat-shock proteins. The\\nalpha-crystallin is expressed in the retina and over-\\nexpressed during diabetes as an adaptive response of ret-\\ninal cells [24]. These changes are more specific to DR than\\nalteration of tear fluid proteome. However, the invasive\\nsampling method makes it difficult to introduce vitreous\\nhumour proteomics in the daily clinical practice.\\nAccording to recent publications the protein compos-\\nition of tear fluid reflects normal or abnormal condi-\\ntions, which justifies the use of tear fluid for screening\\npurposes. Electrophoresis and chromatography also sup-\\nport that protein patterns of healthy and diabetic people\\nare significantly different [25,26].\\nQualitative and quantitative methods used for tear\\nfluid examinations include one and two dimensional\\nelectrophoresis,\\nenzyme-linked\\nimmunosorbent\\nassay\\nand high throughput liquid chromatography [27-29]. Re-\\ncently, high sensitivity and high resolution procedures\\nwere used for the assessment of the effects of trauma\\nand various diseases in tear fluid of microliter quantity.\\nIn these cases, protein profiles were characterized by\\nmass spectrometers MALDI-TOF, SELDI-TOF and LC/\\nMS [30-33].\\nIn a previous study we examined the changes of tear\\nprotein concentrations in DR aiming to identify and\\nTorok et al.

Tear fluid samples were exam-\\nined by quantitative mass spectrometry, and 6 potential\\nbiomarkers namely lipocalin 1, lactotransferrin, lacritin,\\nlysozyme C, lipophilin A and immunoglobulin lambda\\nchain were identified. The results of that study have\\nalready been published elsewhere [34].\\nIn this paper, we evaluate the usefulness of the previ-\\nously identified DR marker proteins in tear fluid sample\\nfor diagnostic purposes and introduce a method based\\non whole protein pattern analysis, which can be inte-\\ngrated into the screening of DR as a pre-screening\\nprocedure.\\nMachine learning\\nMachine learning is an area of artificial intelligence. IT\\nsystems using machine learning methods are capable to\\nlearn from training datasets and predict possible out-\\ncomes based on new observations. In our case the input\\ndata are coming from proteomics experiments and the\\npredicted outcomes are diseased and non-diseased cases\\n(DR or Non-DR). In the learning phase both input data\\nand outcomes are used by the system. During the pre-\\nscreening process the trained machine learning system\\nwill classify cases into diseased or non-diseased groups.\\nIn our pilot study, we intended to ensure the objectiv-\\nity of the assessment by using the following 6 different\\nmachine learning methods: Support Vector Machine\\n(SVM), Recursive Partitioning (rpart), Random Forest\\n(randomForest), Naive Bayes (naïveBayes), Logistic Re-\\ngression (logReg), K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). Possible\\npositive and negative cases for DR can be identified by\\nmachine learning algorithms, allowing the pre-screened\\npopulation\\n(possible\\npositives)\\nto\\nundergo\\nhuman\\nscreening by using digital retinal imaging. The approach\\npresented in this paper is unique in nature, as no previ-\\nous study was found in the scientific literature investi-\\ngating the applicability of tear fluid proteomics based\\nmethods for DR screening.\\nMethods\\nPatient examination\\n119 patients with diabetes were enrolled in the study. In\\ncase of 73 patients one of the eyes were examined due\\nto difficulties in tear fluid sampling (e.g. keratoconjuncti-\\nvitis sicca, operated eye, noncompliance) or because\\nthe\\nretinal image\\ncouldn’t be\\ntaken\\n(e.g.\\ncataract,\\nhemorrhage, angle-closure glaucoma) or assessed (tech-\\nnical difficulties). Diabetic retinopathy was diagnosed by\\ncapturing 7-field fundus images of the patients, evalu-\\nated by two independent ophthalmologists. Megaplus\\nCamera Model 1,6i/10 BIT Zeiss (Carl Zeiss Ophthalmic\\nSystem A6, Jena, Germany) was used for taking images.\\nOut of the 165 eyes examined, 55 were diagnosed\\nhealthy and 110 showed signs of DR. One patient had\\nDR in one eye only.\\nTear fluid samples were collected from the examined\\neyes by a trained assistant under standardized conditions\\n[35]. Tear samples were collected with glass capillaries\\nimmediately before the pupil dilatation for fundus exam-\\nination under slit lamp illumination from the lower tear\\nmeniscus (a horizontal thickening of the pre-corneal tear\\nfilm by the lower margin) at the lateral canthus. Care\\nwas taken not to touch the conjunctiva. The duration of\\nthe sampling process was recorded and the secretion\\nrate was calculated in microl/min, dividing the obtained\\ntear volume by the time of sample collection. Samples\\nused in this investigation had secretion rates of 5–15 μl/\\nmin. Samples were centrifuged (1800 rpm) for 8–10 mi-\\nnutes immediately after sample collection, supernatants\\nwere deep-frozen at −80°C and were thawed only once\\nfor measurements. Tear samples were examined using\\nstate-of-the-art nano-HPLC coupled ESI-MS/MS mass\\nspectrometry protein identification as described elsewhere\\n[29]. During the protein-based screening procedure pre-\\nproliferative and proliferative retinopathy patients were\\nboth considered important, the term ’patient’ includes\\nboth groups diagnosed by using retina images. Global\\npattern of protein concentrations and its changes were\\ndescribed by the examination of the concentrations of\\n34 different proteins.\\nApplication of machine learning methods\\nBy using machine learning algorithms we intended to\\npredict the possible fulfillment of certain future events–\\nusing empirical data containing incomplete information.\\nIn the present special case, input data (features) are pro-\\ntein levels measured in tear fluids from patients with\\ndiabetes and clinical data regarding their DR status (di-\\nchotomous variable of none or some). As the method is\\ndesigned to be used in screening in the future, high sen-\\nsitivity values were considered as the primary criteria for\\nthe construction of the classifier. This was aimed at min-\\nimizing the number of false negative cases, thus redu-\\ncing the chance for missing sight threatening disease.\\nThe goal of this machine learning approach is to assess\\nthe best classification performance achievable by fitting\\ndifferent models to the dataset (model selection). In\\norder to reach the best possible results, we tested several\\nclassifying\\nalgorithms\\n(SVM,\\nrpart,\\nrandomForest,\\nnaiveBayes, logReg, k-NN).\\nA further objective was to design a marker score for\\nmarker selection, targeting the best performance of the\\ntested models. In order to guarantee comparability at\\nthe parameter adjustment of the different classifiers, we\\napplied the settings providing the best performance re-\\ngarding the particular model. In order to monitor the\\nclassifier’s performance on the dataset, the testing was\\nTorok et al.

During the k-fold cross validation the data set is di-\\nvided into k equal parts. The first k-1 set (training set) is\\nused for model construction and later on it is tested on\\nthe k-fold set (test set). In the further k-1 iteration the\\nsame procedure is followed, on the first k-2 and k-fold\\nset the model is learning and on the k-1 it is validated.\\nAt the end of the cross validation, the estimate is deter-\\nmined as the mean of the features of the k-fold model.\\nIn this study 5-fold cross validation was used. Standard\\nmeasures were applied to assess the performance of the\\ndifferent models, e.g.: specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, F-\\nmeasure (harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity–as\\na single measure for the performance of the model).\\nData analysis software tools\\nWe collected experimental (proteomics) and clinical\\ndata (DR/Non-DR) in an Excel file which was used as in-\\nput data for the analysis.\\nDuring the data analysis process the R statistical frame-\\nwork and the following packages have been used: Support\\nVector Machine: “e1071”; Recursive Partitioning: “rpart”;\\nRandom Forest: “randomForest”; Naive Bayes: “naiveBayes”;\\nLogistic Regression: “glmnet” and for visualization purpose:\\n“ggplot2” [37]. We have developed our own solution for the\\nK-Nearest Neighbor model.\\nWe ran cross validation using the three different ap-\\nproaches below in order to find the best combination of\\ninput data and the different models.\\nFirst, we used data from all 34 identified proteins for\\nmodel development.\\nHowever, we also wanted to analyze the changes in the\\nperformance of the classifiers if we only use a subset of\\nthe data. Thus, second, only 6 marker proteins (out of\\nthe\\n34)–previously\\nextracted\\nby\\nclassical\\nstatistical\\nmethods–were used for decision making, applying the\\nsix machine learning algorithms. Third, we wanted to\\nfurther evaluate the performance of the models by redu-\\ncing the number of input variables therefore we applied\\nprincipal component analysis (PCA). In this case, we\\nperformed dimension reduction to compress the infor-\\nmation included in the original dataset with principal\\ncomponent analysis and used it for the visualization of\\nthe complex dataset in a 2D plane. With this method\\nthe number of input features could be decreased while\\nas much of the variation in data as possible could be\\nretained. Thus, we had fewer input features which are\\nthe linear combinations of the original variables and\\nuncorrelated with each other.\\nStatement of ethics\\nWe certify that all applicable institutional and govern-\\nmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human\\nTable 1 Performance measures of the six different classifiers\\nModel\\nDataset\\nSENS\\nSPC\\nACC\\nPREC\\nNPV\\nF1\\nLRP\\nLRN\\nnaiveBayes\\norig\\n0.6991\\n0.4186\\n0.6218\\n0.7596\\n0.3462\\n0.7281\\n1.2025\\n0.7188\\nmarker\\n0.8000\\n0.3874\\n0.5064\\n0.3462\\n0.8269\\n0.4832\\n1.3059\\n0.5163\\npca\\n0.6731\\n0.3365\\n0.4487\\n0.3365\\n0.6731\\n0.4487\\n1.0145\\n0.9714\\nkNN\\norig\\n0.6711\\n0.5000\\n0.6667\\n0.9808\\n0.0385\\n0.7969\\n1.3421\\n0.6579\\nmarker\\n0.6688\\n0.5000\\n0.6667\\n0.9904\\n0.0192\\n0.7984\\n1.3377\\n0.6623\\npca\\n0.6643\\n0.3077\\n0.6346\\n0.9135\\n0.0769\\n0.7692\\n0.9596\\n1.0909\\nlogReg\\norig\\n0.6923\\n0.3846\\n0.5897\\n0.6923\\n0.3846\\n0.6923\\n1.1250\\n0.8000\\nmarker\\n0.6615\\n0.3077\\n0.6026\\n0.8269\\n0.1538\\n0.7350\\n0.9556\\n1.1000\\npca\\n0.6623\\n0.0000\\n0.6538\\n0.9808\\n0.0000\\n0.7907\\n0.6623\\nInf\\nrandomForest\\norig\\n0.6929\\n0.4483\\n0.6474\\n0.8462\\n0.2500\\n0.7619\\n1.2559\\n0.6850\\nmarker\\n0.6923\\n0.4103\\n0.6218\\n0.7788\\n0.3077\\n0.7330\\n1.1739\\n0.7500\\npca\\n0.6748\\n0.3636\\n0.6090\\n0.7981\\n0.2308\\n0.7313\\n1.0604\\n0.8943\\nrpart\\norig\\n0.7083\\n0.4722\\n0.6538\\n0.8173\\n0.3269\\n0.7589\\n1.3421\\n0.6176\\nmarker\\n0.7404\\n0.4808\\n0.6538\\n0.7404\\n0.4808\\n0.7404\\n1.4259\\n0.5400\\npca\\n0.6935\\n0.4375\\n0.6410\\n0.8269\\n0.2692\\n0.7544\\n1.2330\\n0.7005\\nSVM\\norig\\n0.6645\\n0.0000\\n0.6603\\n0.9904\\n0.0000\\n0.7954\\n0.6645\\nInf\\nmarker\\n0.6623\\n0.0000\\n0.6538\\n0.9808\\n0.0000\\n0.7907\\n0.6623\\nInf\\npca\\n0.6623\\n0.0000\\n0.6538\\n0.9808\\n0.0000\\n0.7907\\n0.6623\\nInf\\nPerformance measures of the six different classifiers on the different input data: orig-full data set; marker- candidate marker proteins only; pca–PCA transformed\\ndata.

Random Forest method performs slightly worse\\nthan Recursive Partitioning.\\nSix proteins were identified as independent biomarkers\\nout of the 34 candidate protein, by using statistical hy-\\npothesis testing.\\nThere is additional information in the joint distribu-\\ntion of the whole dataset, thus we wanted to examine\\nthe maximum possible performance of the model.\\nOur reason for examining the performance of the re-\\nduced set was to develop a practical method for screen-\\ning, without compromising the performance of the test.\\nWe have found that neither the models built on just\\nthe 6 marker proteins nor the models built on the PCA\\npreprocessed data performed better or worse than the\\nmodels built on the whole protein patterns. After Princi-\\npal Component Analysis the first two components\\nretained 22% of the variation of the original data set.\\nTable 1 shows that in case of retaining the first two com-\\nponents only, performance measures does not change\\nconsiderably. As a visual presentation of the data we\\nhave generated a scatter plot of the first two compo-\\nnents. Figure 1 presents the lack of clear decision\\nboundary separating the two classes.\\nAs part of our descriptive analysis we evaluated and vi-\\nsualized the correlation between the predictor variables\\n(protein levels) and also between predictor and outcome\\nvariables (DR or non-DR) to have a better understanding\\non the structure of the data set. According to the prob-\\nability density function of the correlation values in most\\nof the cases there are low correlation between predictors\\nand predictors/outcomes (Figure 2). These figures sug-\\ngest that the predictors used separately will not be suffi-\\ncient for the classification.\\nFigure 1 Scatter plot. Scatter plot of the PCA transformed data set.

This finding suggests that these classifiers have\\nhigh variance and getting more training data might help\\nwith the performance. In case of Logistic Regression\\n(Logreg) and Naive Bayes (naiveBayes) we do not see a\\ngap, but both training and test errors are high, indicating\\nthat the models are too simple, thus, we have underfit\\nthe data.\\nConclusions\\nWe hypothesized at the beginning of the study, that the\\nsystem may be utilized for pre-screening purposes,\\nsubstantially-in long term-reducing the cost of regular\\nscreening and the need for health professionals in the\\nprocess. A possible advantage of this method is that the\\npre-screening of the risk population (i.e. diabetic pa-\\ntients) can be performed at the patient’s home. Patients\\ncan take tear sample by their own, using sampling capil-\\nlaries delivered by post, and then returning it to the la-\\nboratory. Only those with positive screening results\\nshould visit a DR screening center.\\nBased on this pilot study, sensitivity and specificity\\nvalues of the system examined on a test database were\\nnot found high enough to unequivocally support its use\\nas a pre-screening method prior to currently applied\\nscreening procedures. However, the results of the system\\nmay be further improved by the enlargement of the\\nlearning database.\\nAnother promising application of proteomics based\\nmachine learning methods is the support of image pro-\\ncessing based automated methods by improving their\\nperformance to be able to substitute traditional human\\nscreening methods in the future. Given constantly drop-\\nping price of high throughput technologies, methodolo-\\ngies based on such technologies will be available both\\nfor routine point of care diagnostics and screenings [38].\\nOn the other hand, costs of human workforce signifi-\\ncantly increase along with the decreasing accessibility of\\nqualified health care professionals. The net result of\\nthese forces accelerates the future spread of such\\ntechnologies.\\nThis study opens up the possibility of including fea-\\ntures other than protein analysis: e.g. anamnestic clinical\\ndata, results of image processing procedures. Applying\\nmore individual parameters as system inputs may con-\\nsiderably improve the sensitivity indicators of a com-\\nbined system in contrast to the proteomics-alone or\\nimage processing-alone systems. This statement is fur-\\nther emphasized as the results of procedures based on\\nimage processing are highly promising. The system built\\non combined procedures may be applied in the future\\nclinical practice.\\nCompeting interests\\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\nAuthors’ contributions\\nZST carried out the initiation of the research, management and manuscript\\nwriting.

Patients with intermittent claudication experience lower limb pain after walking\\nfor a short time. However, rest relieves the pain and allows the patient to walk again. Unfortunately, this symptom predominantly\\narises from not 1 but 2 different diseases: LSS (lumber spinal canal stenosis) and PAD (peripheral arterial disease). Patients with\\nLSS can be subdivided by the affected vertebra into 2 main groups: L4 and L5. It is clinically very important to determine whether\\npatients with intermittent claudication suffer from PAD, L4, or L5. This paper presents a novel SVM- (support vector machine-\\n) based methodology for such discrimination/differentiation using minimally required data, simple walking motion data in the\\nsagittal plane. We constructed a simple walking measurement system that is easy to set up and calibrate and suitable for use by\\nnonspecialists in small spaces. We analyzed the obtained gait patterns and derived input parameters for SVM that are also visually\\ndetectable and medically meaningful/consistent differentiation features. We present a differentiation methodology utilizing an SVM\\nclassifier. Leave-one-out cross-validation of differentiation/classification by this method yielded a total accuracy of 83%.\\n1. Introduction\\nIntermittent claudication [1] is a walking symptom. Patients\\nwith intermittent claudication suffer from lower limb pain\\nafter a walking for a short time. However, rest relieves the\\npain and allows the patient to walk again. As intermittent\\nclaudication involves trouble walking, patients often consult\\nan orthopedic surgeon, and the number of such consultations\\nhas recently increased markedly [2]. Unfortunately, inter-\\nmittent claudication is predominantly caused by not 1 but\\n2 different diseases: LSS (lumber spinal canal stenosis) and\\nPAD (peripheral arterial disease). Toribatake et al. [1–3] noted\\nthat PAD and LSS produce similar symptoms and emphasized\\nthe significance of their differential diagnosis. Therefore, it is\\nclinically very important (especially for orthopedic surgeons)\\nto identify the causative disease of intermittent claudication.\\nAmong the types of LSS, we focused on the L4 and L5\\nsubtypes, which cause radicular symptoms that are mainly\\nresponsible for intermittent claudication in patients with LSS;\\nthese subtypes of LSS are difficult to differentiate from PAD\\n[1]. For this disease, L4 and L5 indicate the vertebral level\\naffected by stenosis.\\nThere are 2 categories of examinations for differentiating\\nbetween these conditions. Some examinations are simple\\nbut imprecise and often fail to differentiate the underlying\\ndiseases; 2 examples are palpation and observation of stand-\\ning posture. The other examinations are precise but invasive\\nand expensive; some examples are angiography, myelography,\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and measurement of the\\nankle brachial index (ABI) [4]. Furthermore, these exam-\\ninations require highly skilled professionals and precision\\ninstruments. Such complicated and expensive examinations\\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\\ne Scientiﬁc World Journal\\nVolume 2014, Article ID 861529, 10 pages\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/861529\\n2\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\nare difficult to conduct at small hospitals and clinics. Fur-\\nthermore, their high cost is undesirable for the patient. The\\noptimal differentiation method would be an examination that\\nused a minimal number of simple instruments and could be\\neasily performed even by nonspecialists. Notably, the affected\\nparts of the legs differ between the causative diseases and\\ncould thus produce kinematical differences in patients’ gait\\npatterns.\\nIn this context, this study was performed to develop a new\\ndifferentiation methodology utilizing minimally required\\ndata; simple walking motion data. The key features of this\\nmethodology are as follows.\\n(1) The Differentiation Is Based on Minimally Required Walk-\\ning Motion Data. Aiming at the usage in small hospitals or\\nat home, the differentiation was designed to use only the\\n2-dimensional gait pattern in the sagittal plane from the\\nsimple walking motion analysis. This presented a challenge.\\nAdditional advantages of the system are easy set-up and\\ncalibration, a short duration of measurement, and usability\\nin a narrow space and a noncontrolled environment by\\nnonspecialists.\\n(2) SVM (Support Vector Machine) [5, 6] Classifier-Based\\nMethodology with a High Rate of Accuracy. There is no\\nresearch focusing on differentiating between PAD and LSS\\nusing gait feature analysis except for our own previous reports\\n[3, 7]. We present an SVM classifier-based methodology\\nwhich is an extended version of one-versus-the-rest multi-\\nclass SVM classifier. Leave-one-out cross-validation showed a\\nhigh rate of accuracy (83% in total) for differentiating among\\nthe normal (normal healthy individuals), PAD, L4, and L5\\ngroups.\\n(3) Derivation of Medically Meaningful Differentiation Fea-\\ntures Available for Visual Examination. The key for obtain-\\ning differentiation with high accuracy is how to con-\\nstruct/select the features, that is, the input to classi-\\nfiers. Our own previous reports [3, 7] show that differ-\\nent diseases produce kinematical differences in gait pat-\\nterns. Focusing on this fact, we select/produce kinemati-\\ncal features in gait patterns for the differentiation. Addi-\\ntional advantage is that because these features are visually\\ndetectable and medically meaningful/consistent, these fea-\\ntures are also available for a medical interview or visual\\nexamination.\\nRelated Works. We have conducted the only studies thus far\\nto use gait analysis to differentiate between patients with\\nLSS and PAD [3, 7]. The present study differs from our past\\nreports [3, 7] in its inclusion of the presented classification\\nmethodology and the results thereof as well as in the added\\ndifferentiation features (amplitude of the femur angle, maxi-\\nmally contracted muscle length of the gastrocnemius muscle\\nfrom the reference model, and maximally relaxed muscle\\nlength of the quadriceps muscle from the reference model).\\nIf we do not restrict ourselves to differentiation of the causes\\nof intermittent claudication, there have been a number of\\nstudies concerning the analysis of intermittent claudication\\nand the classification of gait patterns. Here, we briefly review\\nthem.\\nGait Analysis of Patients with LSS. Suda et al. [8] evaluated\\nthe improvement in gait after surgical treatment of patients\\nwith neurogenic intermittent claudication. Papadakis et al.\\n[9] compared the gait patterns of healthy people with those\\nof patients with LSS; they also evaluated the postoperative\\nprogression of the gait pattern of patients with LSS [10] and\\nshowed that the variability of the gait decreased relatively to\\nthe preoperative gait pattern.

Motion Capture. Figure 1 shows the walking motion\\nmeasurement system. As simplicity was one of our require-\\nments, we constructed the system to obtain 2-dimensional\\ngait patterns and aimed to derive the differentiation features\\nand differentiate the diseases using the minimum amount\\nof information. We constructed the measurement system as\\nsimply as possible, with easy set-up and calibration, to allow\\nits use in small hospitals even by a few nonspecialized medical\\npersonnel. Other aims were a short duration of measurement,\\nability to obtain measurements in a narrow space, and ability\\nto obtain measurements in a noncontrolled environment.\\nWe measured the participants’ gait patterns using light-\\nemitting diode (LED) markers and had them walk on the\\ntreadmill in semidarkness so that the LED marker posi-\\ntions could be easily captured. Semidarkness can convert a\\nnoncontrolled environment into a controlled environment.\\nWe placed handmade LED markers on each participant’s\\nacromion, anterior superior iliac, fibular head, lateral malleo-\\nlus, and fifth metatarsal head. Figure 2(a) shows the definition\\nof the coordinate frame and the marker positions. Note that\\nthe right side is forward in Figure 2. The LED markers were\\nattached to the impaired leg. The participants practiced walk-\\ning on the treadmill before the experiment for safety and to\\ndetermine the appropriate treadmill speed. The latter was set\\nto allow the participant to walk normally. The measurement\\nwas stopped if the participant felt pain. For safety, medical\\ndoctors stood by and watched each participant so that they\\ncould immediately stop the treadmill and help the participant\\nin the event of an accident. We used a commercially available\\ncamera with a frame rate of 30 frames/s. Note that the\\nobtained angle values were only used for analysis and that no\\ncalibration (such as measurement of leg length) was required\\nor conducted.\\n2.1.3. Analysis. The angles used for analysis are shown in\\nFigure 2(b). We detected the marker positions using our own\\nalgorithm [3] based on an LK (Lucas-Kanade) filter [20]. We\\nderived the angles from the marker positions. Note that the\\nangles are not identical to the actual joint angles because they\\nare mapped on the sagittal plane, and we therefore renamed\\nthem according to our own system. The mean data for 1 cycle\\nof gait pattern were analyzed. The accuracy of this system\\ndepends on the resolution of the camera and the distance\\nbetween the treadmill and camera and was from 0.007 to 0.04\\n[rad] for our set-up.\\n2.2. Extracted Features. Our goal was to identify the causative\\ndisease of intermittent claudication. As described previously,\\nthe candidate diseases are PAD and 2 varieties of LSS, L5 and\\nL4. We also included a number of normal healthy participants\\nas a control group. In order to get the features, that is,\\nthe input variables for classifiers, we extract the features\\nof gait pattern in the 4 groups; normal, PAD, L5, and L4.\\nTable 1 shows the list of the extracted features, including the\\ninformation about which features are used in the presented\\nSVM classifier-based methodology described in Section 2.3.\\nFocusing on the characteristic of each disease such as the\\nareas where disruption of sensation and ischemia occur, we\\nextracted the features associated with the motions of the\\nangles of single joints. We remark about how to the knee\\nangle at the start of the stance phase. The start of the stance\\nphase was defined as the time at which the 𝑥 component of\\nthe marker attached to the fifth metatarsal head was maximal.\\nThe time at which the foot reaches its most forward position is\\nnot always identical to the start of the true stance phase, which\\nit may precede. Therefore, we define that the knee angle at the\\nstart of the stance phase is the mean of the values of the knee\\nangles from 4 frames before the start of the stance phase to\\nthe start of the stance phase. Letting 𝑞3(𝑘) be the knee angle\\nat 𝑡 = 𝑘 and 𝑘ss be the time at which the stance phase started,\\nwe calculated the mean 𝑞3(𝑘) from 𝑡 = 𝑘ss − 4 to 𝑡 = 𝑘ss. This\\nwas recorded as the value of the knee angle at the start of the\\nstance phase.\\nThe analysis of the angles of single joints corresponds to\\nanalysis of monoarticular muscles. However, there are also\\nmuscles that influence the angles of 2 adjacent joints, and\\nit may be possible to derive features associated with these\\nbiarticular muscles. Therefore, we also extracted the features\\nassociated with biarticular muscles. Individual differences in\\nbody size make direct comparison of muscle lengths illogical;\\ntherefore, we used a reference model based on the bone\\nlengths of the actual human skeleton model in our laboratory.\\nWe based the sites of attachment of the muscles to the\\nbones in the reference model on anatomical data [21, 22].\\nFigure 3 shows the resulting reference model. We focused\\non the gastrocnemius muscle where it is considered to be\\nthe affected area for PAD, and the quadriceps muscle where\\nit is considered to be the affected area for L4. The input\\nfor this model was the knee and ankle (upper body, femur,\\nand knee) angles of a given participant and the output was\\nthe length of the gastrocnemius (quadriceps) muscle in the\\nreference model. The value thus derived differed from the\\nparticipant’s actual muscle length but could be compared with\\nthose of the other participants. We therefore let the muscle\\nlength derived from the model represent the participant’s\\nmuscle length. These values could thus be said to represent\\nnormalized muscle lengths.\\n4\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\nAcromion\\nAnterior superior iliac \\nHead of the fibula \\nLateral malleolus  \\nThe fifth metatarsal head \\nx\\ny\\n(a) Marker positions\\nAnkle angle\\nKnee angle\\nFemur angle\\nUpper body angle\\nx\\ny\\n(b) Angles\\nFigure 2: Coordinate frame, marker positions, and angles.\\nFoot\\nGastrocnemius stop position\\n370mm\\nGastrocnemius\\n50mm\\n40mm\\nGastrocnemius start position\\n𝜃3 (knee angle)\\n𝜃4 (ankle angle)\\n(a) Reference model for the gastrocnemius muscle\\nRectus femoris\\nRectus femoris start position\\nPatella\\n40mm\\n40mm\\n440mm\\nRectus femoris stop position\\n𝜃3 (knee angle)\\nRectus femoris passage position\\n60mm\\n𝜃1(upper body angle) + 𝜃2(femur angle)\\n(b) Reference model for quadriceps muscle\\nFigure 3: Reference models for calculating normalized biarticular muscle lengths.\\n2.3. SVM Classifier-Based Methodology for the Differentiation\\n2.3.1. Methodology Based on the Support Vector Machine\\n(SVM). We will first introduce SVM [23–25]. SVM was\\noriginally a binary (2-class) classifier. Consider the given data\\nset (x1, 𝑦1), . . . , (x𝑚, 𝑦𝑚), where x𝑖 ∈ R𝑛 and 𝑦𝑖 ∈ {−1, 1}\\nis labeled for x𝑖. Then, we solve the following quadratic\\nfunction:\\nmin\\nw,𝑏,𝜉\\n1\\n2w𝑇w + 𝐶\\n𝑚\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n𝜉𝑖\\nSubject to 𝑦𝑖 (w𝑇𝜙 (x) + 𝑏) ≥ 1 − 𝜉𝑖\\n𝜉𝑖 ≥ 0.\\n(1)\\nHere, the function 𝜙 maps data x𝑖 to the higher-\\ndimensional feature space 𝜙 : R𝑛\\n→\\nF. The following\\nhyperplane in the feature space splits the data into the 2\\nlabeled classes:\\n𝑓 (x) = w𝑇𝜙 (x) + 𝑏,\\n(2)\\nwhere w and 𝑏 are the parameters that specify the linear\\nhyperplane. This can provide a nonlinear boundary for the\\n2 labeled classes in the original data space. Note that the\\nhyperplane containing 𝑦𝑖(w𝑇𝜙(x) + 𝑏) = 1 − 𝜉𝑖 is called the\\nsupport vector. 𝜉𝑖 is termed the slack variable, and its solution\\ngives the maximal margin for classification error. 𝐶 > 0 is\\nthe parameter controlling the tradeoff between the number of\\nmisclassified data points in the training and the separation of\\nthe remaining data with the maximal margin. The function 𝜙\\nconstructs a kernel function such as 𝐾(x𝑖, x𝑗) = 𝜙(x𝑖)𝑇 𝜙(x𝑖).\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\n5\\nThe following are well-known candidates for the kernel\\nfunction:\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = x𝑇\\n𝑖 x𝑗\\nlinear,\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = (𝛾x𝑇\\n𝑖 x𝑗 + 𝑟)\\n𝑑,\\n𝛾 > 0\\npolynomial,\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = exp (𝛾󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩x𝑖 − x𝑗\\n󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩󵄩\\n2) ,\\n𝛾 > 0\\nRBF,\\n𝐾 (x𝑖, x𝑗) = tanh (𝛾x𝑇\\n𝑖 x𝑗 + 𝑟)\\nsigmoid,\\n(3)\\nwhere 𝛾, 𝑟, and 𝑑 are kernel parameters and RBF is the radial\\nbasis function. Given test data x𝑡, the classifying decision is\\nmade by\\nsgn (𝑓 (x𝑡)) = sgn (w𝑇𝜙 (x𝑡) + 𝑏) .\\n(4)\\nThe goal of our differentiation was to determine to which\\nof the normal, PAD, L5, and L4 groups a given (test) dataset\\nbelongs. Therefore, a 4-class classifier was needed. The binary\\nSVM classifier can be extended to a multiclass classifier [23,\\n25, 26]. There are 2 main approaches to constructing a 𝑘-class\\nSVM. The first is to train the binary classifier with regard to\\nall combinations (totaling 𝑘(𝑘 − 1)/2). If test data are given,\\nwe apply the 𝑘(𝑘 − 1)/2 classifiers to it and decide the final\\noutput by voting, with the most-voted class being the final\\noutput. This method is called one-versus-one (OVO). The\\nother approach is to train a 𝑘-independent binary classifier\\nby training the 𝑖th classifier to regard the 𝑖th class as the class\\nwith the positive label and the remaining classes as the class\\nwith the negative label. The 𝑖th classifier decision is made by\\nsgn (𝑓𝑖 (x𝑡)) = sgn (w𝑇\\n𝑖 𝜙 (x𝑡) + 𝑏𝑖) .\\n(5)\\nThe overall decision is made by\\n𝑖 = argmax\\n𝑖\\n𝑓𝑖 (x𝑡) .\\n(6)\\nThis approach is called one-versus-the-rest (OVR).\\nPresented Methodology. Not all features are always suitable for\\ndifferentiating a certain group from the other groups (see the\\ndata for the features shown in Figures 4∼12). In this case, a\\nvoting-based method, which does not take the magnitude of\\nthe possibility value into account (but instead provides 0 or\\n1), does not always work well. With this in mind, we present\\na differentiation methodology based on OVR. Other merits\\nof OVR are that it is simple and first-running and that it is\\neasy to optimize the parameters for the classifications. The\\nmethodology is as follows.\\nTraining. We trained 4 binary classifiers, each of which was for\\nclassifying 1 class versus the other classes: (1) normal versus\\nthe other groups, (2) PAD versus the other groups, (3) L5\\nversus the other groups, and (4) L4 versus the other groups.\\nWe selected appropriate features for every binary classifier\\nbased on the significant differences described in Section 3.\\nThe features selected are shown in Table 1.

First, the corresponding features of the given\\ntest/sample (walking motion) data were calculated. Using\\nthese features, we calculated the decision value 𝑓𝑖(x𝑡) (5) for\\neach classifier. Then, from (6), we obtained the final output.\\n3. Results and Discussion\\n3.1. Features Associated with the Motions of the Angles of Single\\nJoints. We first investigated the features associated with the\\nmotions of the angles of single joints. Figures 4, 5, and 6 show\\nthe results.\\n3.1.1. Mean Ankle Angle. Figure 4 shows that the ankle angle\\nwas larger in the PAD group and smaller in the L5 group\\nthan in the normal and L4 groups and differed significantly\\nbetween the PAD and L5 groups according to the Tukey-\\nKramer method. A multiclass classification such as the\\nSVM (OVR) generally requires classification/differentiation\\nbetween a given group and all other groups, so the most useful\\nfeatures are those that are largest or smallest for a certain\\n(target) group. Therefore, the mean ankle angle appeared\\nuseful for differentiating either PAD or L5 from the other\\ngroups.\\nPatients with PAD are susceptible to ischemia of the\\ntriceps surae muscles and therefore move to prevent the\\ncollapse and stenosis of the blood vessels inside these muscles.\\nThe patient attempts to keep the radii of the blood vessels\\nlarge in order to minimize the loss of blood flow and thus\\navoid muscle ischemia. To accomplish this, the patient with\\nPAD tends to keep the angle of the ankle large at all times. In\\ncontrast, patients with LSS (L5) have disruption of sensation\\naround the tibialis anterior muscle and the bottom surface of\\nthe foot. This increases the risk for collision between the tip of\\n6\\nThe Scientific World Journal\\nTable 1: Extracted features for differentiating among normal, PAD, L5 and L4, and which features are used in the presented SVM classifier-\\nbased methodology.

These trends are considered to produce large mean\\nankle angle in PAD group while small in L5 group.\\n3.1.2. Knee Angle at the Start of the Stance Phase.

We first considered the values for the length of\\nthe gastrocnemius muscle. Both the maximally relaxed and\\nmaximally contracted lengths increased from the PAD to\\nthe L4 to the L5 group. Only the normal group showed a\\ndifferent tendency, consistent with the results for the range\\nof motion. Statistically significant differences were evident\\nbetween many of the groups. The small values of every feature\\nin the PAD group were consistent with the hypothesis that\\nthe patient keeps the length of the gastrocnemius muscle\\nshort. On the other hand, the large maximally relaxed and\\ncontracted muscle lengths and small range of motion in the\\nLSS (L5) group support the hypothesis that the patient keeps\\nthe angle of the ankle small and avoids lifting up the legs. The\\nmaximally relaxed length appeared useful for differentiating\\nPAD or L5 from the other groups, whereas the maximally\\ncontracted length appeared useful for differentiating L5 from\\nthe other groups. The range of motion was significantly\\ngreater in the normal group than in all other groups and\\nwould therefore be useful for differentiating the normal group\\nfrom the other groups.\\nWe next considered the values for the length of the\\nquadriceps muscle. The maximally contracted length was\\nsmallest in the L4 group, although the differences were slight.\\nThis corresponds to the hypothesis that patients with L4\\nLSS keep the quadriceps muscle contracted, especially during\\nlanding. The range of motion was larger in the normal and L4\\ngroups and smaller in the L5 group. This was attributed to the\\ntendency of patients with L5 LSS to avoid lifting up their legs,\\nas described above. This feature appeared potentially useful\\nfor differentiating between the L4 and normal groups and\\nthe other groups but more useful for differentiating the L5\\ngroup from the other groups.

We used leave-\\none-out cross-validation for the evaluation. Note that we used\\nnormalized data for input to every classifier. We remark about\\nthe implantation of SVM. The implantation was conducted\\nbased on LIBSVM [24]. The RBF was chosen as the kernel\\nfunction. The values for the 2 parameters 𝐶 and 𝛾 for the\\nclassifications were determined by a grid search [24]. The\\ngrid search finds good values by evaluating (e.g., from cross-\\nvalidation results) exponentially increasing values of 𝐶 and 𝛾\\n(such as 𝐶 = 2−5, 2−3, . . . , 𝛾 = 2−5, 2−3, . . .).

We attribute the high accuracy for this group to the\\nlarge differences in the corresponding features between the\\nPAD group and the other groups. In contrast, identification\\nof the L4 group was difficult. This is true for the results in\\nall the classifiers.

Conclusion\\nIntermittent claudication is caused mainly by 2 different\\ndiseases, LSS (lumber spinal canal stenosis) and PAD (periph-\\neral arterial disease). LSS can be subdivided into L4 and\\nL5 disease. The medical treatments for these conditions\\nare completely different, making their differentiation very\\nimportant. At present, the diagnosis is made by analyzing\\nmany results from many examinations, including sophisti-\\ncated methods such as MRI. This methodology is available\\nonly at well-equipped hospitals. With this in mind, this paper\\npresents a novel SVM-based methodology for differentiating\\namong normal healthy people and patients with PAD, L4,\\nand L5 utilizing minimally required data, simple walking\\nmotion data. The simple walking measurement system was\\nconstructed to obtain 2-dimensional gait patterns in the\\nsagittal plane and is intended for use at small hospitals or\\nat home. The system’s other key features are easy set-up\\nand calibration, a short duration of measurement, usability\\nin a narrow space by nonspecialists, and ability to obtain\\nmeasurements in a noncontrolled environment. From the gait\\npatterns, we then extracted several visually detectable and\\nmedically meaningful/consistent differentiation features that\\nare also available for a medical interview or visual exam-\\nination. The extracted features can largely be categorized\\ninto 2 groups: those associated with the angles of single\\njoints (monoarticular muscles) and those associated with the\\nangles of 2 adjacent joints (biarticular muscles). We used\\nthe derived differentiation features to construct an SVM-\\n(support vector machine-) based differentiation method.\\nThe differentiation/classification was developed successfully\\nand yielded a total accuracy of 83% in leave-one-out cross-\\nvalidation. The accuracy of the differentiation/classification\\nwas lower for identification of patients with L4. Our future\\nwork will focus on improving the accuracy of this diagnostic\\nmethod.\\nConflict of Interests\\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\\nregarding the publication of this paper.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank Ms. Yui Sano and Mr. Shinji\\nHabe for helping with analysis of gait pattern data.\\nReferences\\n[1] Y.

algorithms\\nZeenia Jagga, Dinesh Gupta*\\nFrom Great Lakes Bioinformatics Conference 2014\\nCincinnati, OH, USA. 16-18 May 2014\\nAbstract\\nBackground: Clear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most- prevalent, chemotherapy resistant and lethal\\nadult kidney cancer. There is a need for novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ccRCC, due to its\\nheterogeneous molecular profiles and asymptomatic early stage. This study aims to develop classification\\nmodels to distinguish early stage and late stage of ccRCC based on gene expression profiles. We employed\\nsupervised learning algorithms- J48, Random Forest, SMO and Naïve Bayes; with enriched model learning by fast\\ncorrelation based feature selection to develop classification models trained on sequencing based gene\\nexpression data of RNAseq experiments, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas.\\nResults: Different models developed in the study were evaluated on the basis of 10 fold cross validations and\\nindependent dataset testing. Random Forest based prediction model performed best amongst the models developed\\nin the study, with a sensitivity of 89%, accuracy of 77% and area under Receivers Operating Curve of 0.8.\\nConclusions: We anticipate that the prioritized subset of 62 genes and prediction models developed in this study\\nwill aid experimental oncologists to expedite understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stage progression\\nand discovery of prognostic factors for ccRCC tumors.\\nBackground\\nRenal cell carcinoma is a common adult kidney cancer,\\naccounting for 2-3% of all new cancer cases diagnosed\\nworldwide [1]. Detection of renal cell carcinoma at an\\nearly stage is difficult and generally diagnosed incidentally\\n[2]. Most cases can be treated effectively only if detected\\ntimely, increasing the survival rates of patients [3]. The\\nclear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most\\ncommon subtype of the renal cell carcinoma, character-\\nized by clear cell morphology of the cytoplasm [4]. So\\nfar, early stage diagnosis is difficult due to the molecular\\ncomplexity and divergent clinical behavior of ccRCC\\npatients [5]. Hence, there is an urgent need to determine\\ncandidate biomarkers for diagnosis and/or prognosis for\\nstage specific distinction in ccRCC.\\nAdvancements in high throughput technologies like\\nNext Generation Sequencing have opened novel avenues\\nin cancer research with renewed emphasis on diagnosis,\\nprognosis and therapeutics. The launch of large scale\\ncomprehensive multi-node programs like International\\nCancer Genomic consortium [ICGC] (http://icgc.org/) and\\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] (http://cancergenome.\\nnih.gov/) enables systematic studies on genomic, epige-\\nnomic and transcriptomic levels for different cancer types\\nthat hold clinical and societal importance globally [6].\\nThese projects are making data available to researchers in\\ndifferent levels 1, 2, 3, 4 (i.e. raw, processed, interpreted\\n* Correspondence: dinesh@icgeb.res.in\\nBioinformatics Laboratory, Structural and Computational Biology Group,\\nInternational Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB),\\nAruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, India\\nJagga and Gupta BMC Proceedings 2014, 8(Suppl 6):S2\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/8/S6/S2\\n© 2014 Jagga and Gupta; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In order to analyze\\ndiverse and multidimensional cancer related data, machine\\nlearning techniques are being extensively applied for\\ncancer prognosis as well as diagnosis [9,10].\\nIn ccRCC, clinical tumor staging by TNM staging\\nsystem is used - as prognostic factor; determines treatment\\nregimen of patient; confirmed to guide the surveillance\\nprotocols and to assess risk of metastatic renal cell\\ncarcinoma [3,11-13]. Although tumor stage being an effec-\\ntive prognostic factor, to our knowledge there has been no\\nsystematic studies characterizing gene expression data for\\ntumor stage progression. Thereby, we hypothesized that\\nidentifying gene expression signature that correlates with\\nclinical tumor stage progression might lead to discovery of\\na panel of prognostic molecular signatures for ccRCC\\ntumors.\\nIn this study, we have developed prediction models to\\ndiscriminate clinical tumor stages- early stage (I, II) and\\nlate stage (III, IV) of ccRCC. The prediction models are\\ntrained on gene expression data of RNAseq experiments\\nfrom TCGA by implementing state-of-art supervised\\nmachine learning algorithms. The gene expression signa-\\ntures identified by feature selection approach, which\\nenriched classifier training, helped us to efficiently classify\\nthe tumors based on their clinical tumor stage. Further,\\nwe found that amongst the implemented machine learn-\\ning techniques, predictive models based on Random\\nForest algorithm performed the best with accuracy of\\n76.84% on independent data test, area under Receiver\\nOperating Characteristic Curve (auROC) of 0.778.\\nMethods\\nThe overall methodology followed in the article is\\nsummarized in Figure 1.\\nData mining\\nThe dataset for this study was downloaded from TCGA\\ndata portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcga-\\nHome2.jsp). The Level 3 RNAseq expression dataset\\nfrom cancer type KIRC i.e. Kidney Renal clear cell carci-\\nnoma on Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA sequencing plat-\\nform was obtained from TCGA data portal [14]. The\\nRNAseq expression data was available for 475 tumor\\nsamples. Each patient gene expression profile consists of\\ngene expression data for 20,534 genes. Only tumor sam-\\nples were taken into account in the study. The clinical\\ninformation for selected subjects was retrieved from the\\n“clinical Biotab” section of the data matrix based on the\\nBCR (Biospecimen Core Resource) IDs of the patients.\\nWe generated a gene expression data matrix in Comma\\nSeparated Value (CSV) file format from the data retrieved\\nfrom the TCGA data portal, with 20,534 genes as column\\nlabels and 475 patients BCR ids as row labels. This was\\nachieved using in-house shell scripts. The ‘Reads Per\\nKilobase per Million’ i.e. RPKM values of the mapped\\nreads, retrieved as an estimate for gene expression, were\\nused as feature vectors for classifiers trainings. In order to\\ngenerate a study dataset, we marked class label of “Early\\nStage” for patients with clinical tumor stage I & II, and\\nclass labels of “Late Stage” for tumor stage III & IV.\\nTesting and Training dataset gene expression matrix\\nwith 9756650 (20,534 × 475) data points was randomly\\nstratified and split into 80% training-cum-validation data-\\nset (Additional File 2) and 20% independent testing dataset\\n(Additional File 3) using a PERL script, developed in\\nhouse.\\nMachine learning\\nAll the Machine learning steps including data pre-\\nprocessing, feature selection, generating classification\\nmodels and independent testing was performed on\\nWaikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA)\\nversion 3.7.9 [15].\\nFeature selection: For reducing the dimensionality in\\nfeature space and improving instance to feature ratio for\\nbetter machine learning, we combined WEKA attribute\\nevaluator ‘SymmetricalUncertAttributeSetEval’ with\\nsearch method of ‘FCBFSearch’. The algorithm Fast\\nCorrelation Based Feature (FCBF) selection utilizes pre-\\ndominant correlation to identify relevant features in high\\ndimensional datasets [16]. This feature selection method\\nis used in conjunction with evaluator ‘Symmetrical\\nUncert Attribute Eval’, which selects subset of features\\nbased on symmetrical uncertainty with respect to another\\nfeatures [16,17].\\nWe then analyzed this subset gene list for Gene Ontol-\\nogy (GO)- biological process annotations with WebGestalt\\n(http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/), a Web-based\\nGene Set Analysis Toolkit [18]. We visualized the impact\\nof our candidate genes at genomic (mutation, copy\\nnumber alterations), transcriptomic (expression) and\\nprotein levels (expression) in ccRCC TCGA dataset\\nthrough cBio Cancer Genomics Portal [19,20]. We also\\nestimated overall Kaplan-Meier Survival curve based on\\ncases with and without alteration in these genes using\\ncBio Cancer Genomics Portal.\\nClassification algorithms\\nWe employed four different state-of-the-art supervised\\nmachine learning algorithms (J48, Naïve Bayes, Sequential\\nminimal optimization and Random Forest) for generating\\nthe classification models. J48 is the java based implemen-\\ntation decision tree learning algorithm C4.5 [21]. Naïve\\nJagga and Gupta BMC Proceedings 2014, 8(Suppl 6):S2\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/8/S6/S2\\nPage 2 of 7\\nBayes algorithm works on the assumption that all the fea-\\ntures are statistically independent and is based on Bayes\\ntheorem [22]. Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)\\nalgorithm is an implementation of Support Vector Classi-\\nfier [23,24]. Random Forest is randomly constructed\\nensemble of independent decision trees [25].\\nTraining-cum-validation: The four supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms (J48, LibSVM, Naïve Bayes, and Ran-\\ndom Forest) were trained on the subset features from fea-\\nture selection and further validated by 10 fold cross-\\nvalidation. The training models thus generated were com-\\npared based on the accuracy and auROC. Random Forest\\nclassifier was optimized for number of trees and the mod-\\nels were generated using number of trees as 1000.\\nIndependent dataset test: Independent data testing is\\nrecommended to exclude the “memory” effect or bias for\\ntrained classification models [26]. So, we re-evaluated the\\nperformance of best-trained and cross-validated model on\\nindependent dataset.\\nPerformance evaluation\\nIn order to evaluate the generated prediction models we\\nemployed various evaluation metrics recommended for\\nevaluating the classifier’s performances i.e. accuracy,\\nsensitivity or recall, specificity, Matthews Correlation\\nCoefficient (MCC), F-value and auROC [27,28]. The\\nauROC is area under curve and is evaluated for compar-\\ning performance of several classifiers.\\nFigure 1 Schematic representation of the overall strategy used in the study. Data was downloaded from TCGA data portal. Gene\\nexpression values of the tumors constituted the descriptor values. Class labels were derived from the clinical information given in the Biotab of\\nthe TCGA data portal. Resulting data was processed to generate training/testing data files. Feature selection and generation of classification\\nmodels was performed on WEKA Workbench.\\nJagga and Gupta BMC Proceedings 2014, 8(Suppl 6):S2\\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/8/S6/S2\\nPage 3 of 7\\nResults\\nGene expression data matrix\\nThe RNAseq dataset for 475 clinically diagnosed ccRCC\\npatients were retrieved from TCGA data portal. The data-\\nset includes gene expression levels for 20,534 genes in\\ntumor tissue samples of the patients. Thus, we generated a\\nstudy dataset of gene expression data matrix of 20,534 ×\\n475, columns and rows respectively. The data characteris-\\ntics of patients whose gene expression values have been\\nused in this study are given as Additional File 1. Further,\\nthe study dataset was divided into 80% training-cum-\\nvalidation and 20% independent testing dataset. The distri-\\nbution of patients across training and testing dataset by\\nclinical tumor stage is given in Table 1.\\nFeature selection\\nFeature selection performed on training-cum-validation\\ndataset of 219 early stage and 161 late stage instances\\nby fast correlation based feature selection largely\\nreduced the feature vectors space from 20,534 genes to\\n62 genes (see additional files: 4 for list of genes, 5 for\\ndistribution plot of the expression values for all the\\nselected 62 genes). From the GO Slim Annotation of\\nsubset genes, we identified “multicellular organismal\\nprocess” (29 genes), “response to stimulus” (28 genes),\\n“metabolic process” (26 genes) and “biological regula-\\ntion” (26 genes) as most frequent GO annotations for\\nBiological Processes (Additional file 6). Oncoprint of the\\n62 identified candidate gene list by feature selection\\ndetermined the alterations of genomic profiles in 83.6%\\nof ccRCC cases (Additional file 6). Further validation of\\nthe relevance of selected gene features was achieved by\\nperforming survival Kaplan-Meir estimate. The survival\\nestimate revealed that the median months survival in\\ncases with alterations is 73.17 months and cases without\\nalterations is 90.38 months (Additional File 6).\\nTraining-cum-validation\\nWe evaluated training models by 10 fold cross-validation\\nfor the classifiers trained on the four supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms- SMO, Random Forest, J48 and Naïve\\nBayes. All the models were based on standard error base\\nclassifiers. The performances of the generated prediction\\nmodels were compared on the basis of accuracy and\\nauROC values (Table 2). The classification accuracy of the\\ngenerated prediction models ranges from 67.6% for J48, to\\n79.7% for Random Forest; and auROC value ranges from\\n0.7 for J48 to 0.876 for Random Forest. Based on accuracy\\nand auROC, we inferred that Random Forest based predic-\\ntion model has outperformed other three machine learn-\\ning algorithms implemented in the study.\\nIndependent data testing\\nFurthermore, we evaluated our prediction models on an\\nindependent dataset with 55 early stage patients and 40\\nlate stage patients. The performances of the prediction\\nmodels were compared on the basis of standard\\nstatistical measures- accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,\\nF-measure, and auROC (Table 3). We observed coher-\\nence in the performance of the models between inde-\\npendent data testing and 10 fold cross validation based\\non auROC values.\\nWe evaluated sensitivity and specificity plot to deter-\\nmine prediction model with low error rates i.e. high sensi-\\ntivity and specificity. Sensitivity of all the models was in\\nthe range of 79-94%, with highest sensitivity of 93.56% for\\nNaïve Bayes. Specificity of the models varied in a wide\\nrange with lowest of 39.0% for J48 and the highest of\\n60.98% for Random Forest (Figure 2). Although, Naïve\\nBayes based model shows the highest sensitivity, the best\\nsensitivity-specificity trade-off was observed for Random\\nForest Classifier with 88.89% sensitivity and 60.98%\\nspecificity.\\nThe prediction accuracies of all the four predictive mod-\\nels on independent dataset were- 62.11, 72.63, 76.84, 73.68\\nfor J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SMO respec-\\ntively (Table 3). F-measures of the models developed in\\nthe study is between 0.7 to 0.82. It is notable that amongst\\nthe four evaluated prediction models, the model based on\\nRandom Forest displays highest accuracy and F-measure.\\nROC plot is evaluated to characterize threshold inde-\\npendent performance of the prediction models. The ROC\\nplot of the classifiers showing tradeoff between true posi-\\ntive rate and false positive rate in Figure 3 and auROC\\nvalues in Table 3 suggests that prediction models based\\non Random Forest algorithm performed better than\\nNaïve Bayes, SMO and J48.

Previous\\nstudies in ccRCC employs gene expression profiles to pre-\\ndict survival [29,30] and determine newer tumor subtypes\\n[31,32]. We have used gene expression profiles of ccRCC\\nstage specific tumor tissues to train supervised machine\\nlearning algorithms, towards our goal to develop classifica-\\ntion models for early stage to late stage tumor progression\\nof ccRCC.\\nThe TCGA gene expression data for ccRCC patients has\\ndiverse representation of age, gender and tumor stage\\n(Additional File 1). The patients with localized tumors\\n(stage I and II) were class labeled as early stage whereas\\npatients with locally advanced disease (stage III) and meta-\\nstatic disease (stage IV) as late stage. The TCGA gene\\nexpression profile data available for 475 tumor samples\\nand 20,534 genes had no significant batch effects [14] and\\ncame with the “curse of dimensionality”. An efficient fast\\nfilter feature selection method based on predominant\\ncorrelation (fast correlation based feature selection) largely\\nreduced the feature space from 20,534 genes to 62 gene\\nexpression profiles.\\nTo analyze the details of selected training set genes\\nused in development of prediction models for ccRCC,\\nwe first performed GO annotations in which the corre-\\nsponding biological processes displayed very broad but\\nconsistency with cancer hallmarks [33]. Secondly, the\\noncoprint visualization of the selected subset genes\\ndisplayed alterations in all the genomic profiles in 83.6%\\nof the TCGA ccRCC cases. Thirdly, ccRCC cases with\\nalterations in the selected genes had better overall\\nTable 3 Performance of prediction models by standard\\nstatistical evaluation parameters for independent testing\\ndataset.\\nClassifier\\nAccuracy Sensitivity Specificity\\nF-value\\nauROC#\\nJ48\\n62.11\\n79.63%\\n39.02%\\n0.704918\\n0.563\\nNaïve Bayes\\n72.63\\n93.56%\\n48.78%\\n0.790323\\n0.749\\nRandom\\nForest\\n76.84\\n88.89%\\n60.98%\\n0.813559\\n0.778\\nSMO\\n73.68\\n87.04%\\n56.10%\\n0.789916\\n0.716\\n# auROC denotes area under Receivers Operating Characteristic curve.

The results demonstrate that\\nearly stage and late stage ccRCC tumors can be classified\\nwith high sensitivity using gene expression profiles. Our\\nobservations re-emphasizes the fact that machine learning\\nbased models will play important role in the developing\\nfield of predictive and personalized medicine.\\nOur study also illustrates a new method for classification\\nin ccRCC, wherein tumor stage information can be\\nderived from the molecular features, instead of tumor size.\\nIn future, availability of additional ccRCC tumor patients\\nand inclusion of more feature vectors like miRNA expres-\\nsions, protein expression and SNP profiling data could\\nfurther enhance the accuracy of the prediction models\\ngiven the fact that ccRCC tumors typically have heteroge-\\nneous molecular profiles. Though we tested the prediction\\nmodels on independent testing datasets of 95 patients, the\\noutcome of such models needs to be interpreted judi-\\nciously before incorporation into a clinical set up. We\\nanticipate that the selected gene expression features and\\nthe prediction models developed in this study would expe-\\ndite the challenge for discovering molecular prognosis\\nfactors and stage progression molecular signatures in\\nccRCC tumors.\\nConclusion\\nAn empirical approach has been employed in this study\\nto develop classification model for tumor stage progres-\\nsion in ccRCC based on gene expression profiles. We\\nhave identified a subset of 62 genes by feature selection,\\nthe expression profiles of which predominantly corre-\\nlates with tumor-stage of the patient given the heteroge-\\nneous data in terms of tumor stage, age group and\\ngender of the patient. We report that Random Forest\\nbased prediction model accurately and reliably classifies\\npatient tumor stages. We anticipate that such prediction\\nmodels based on the molecular correlates could contri-\\nbute to the optimal management of patients in ccRCC.\\nCurrently, the prediction models generated are available\\nupon request to the authors.

This \\nstudy aimed to investigate effects of clinical and sociode-\\nmographic variables on the classification by applying \\nmultivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to both gray mat-\\nter (GM) volume and FC measures in patients with SZ \\nand healthy controls (HC). RS and structural magnetic \\nresonance imaging data (sMRI) from 74 HC and 71 SZ \\npatients were obtained from a Mind Research Network \\nCOBRE dataset available via COINS (http://coins.mrn.\\norg/dx). We used a MVPA framework using support-vec-\\ntor machines embedded in a repeated, nested cross-vali-\\ndation to generate a multi-modal diagnostic system and \\nevaluate its generalizability. The dependence of neurodi-\\nagnostic performance on clinical and sociodemographic \\nvariables was evaluated. The RS classifier showed a \\nslightly higher accuracy (70.5%) compared to the struc-\\ntural classifier (69.7%). The combination of sMRI and \\nRS outperformed single MRI modalities classification \\nby reaching 75% accuracy. The RS based moderator \\nanalysis revealed that the neurodiagnostic performance \\nwas driven by older SZ patients with an earlier illness \\nonset and more pronounced negative symptoms. In con-\\ntrast, there was no linear relationship between the clinical \\nvariables and neuroanatomically derived group member-\\nship measures. This study achieved higher accuracy dis-\\ntinguishing HC from SZ patients by fusing 2 imaging \\nmodalities. In addition the results of RS based modera-\\ntor analysis showed that age of patients, as well as their \\nage at the illness onset were the most important clinical \\nfeatures.\\nKey words: pattern recognition/schizophrenia/ \\nbrain imaging/multimodal/clinical symptoms\\nIntroduction\\nMultivariate pattern recognition methods, such as sup-\\nport vector machines (SVM)1,2 have recently emerged \\nas promising tools for the diagnosis of schizophrenia \\n(SZ) due to their capacity to extract the inter-regional \\ndependencies of distributed brain patterns from high-\\ndimensional training data and generalize the learned \\ndiscriminative rules to unseen patient cohorts.3–5 \\nClassification results from the recent studies suggest \\nthat grey matter (GM) and functional connectivity \\n(FC) alterations provide useful discriminative power to \\nidentify patients with SZ, revealing complex patterns \\nof cortical changes underlying the symptoms of the \\ndisorder.6\\nExtant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings \\nheavily support the “brain surrogate” of SZ that is not \\nconfined to single regions but rather involves distributed \\npattern of brain alterations in both structural4,7 and func-\\ntional MRI (fMRI) modality.8,9 However, although GM \\nchanges in prefrontal, striatal, temporal and parietal \\nregions, as well as FC deficits in a long- and short-range \\nconnections between these brain regions are well repli-\\ncated they are susceptible to the effects of sociodemo-\\ngraphic variables and age in particular.10–12\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS111\\nClassifying Schizophrenia Using Multimodal Multivariate Pattern Recognition Analysis\\nIn the field of neuroanatomical disease classification it \\nhas also been shown that clinical factors such as patients’ \\nage, age of illness onset and symptoms may affect diag-\\nnostic accuracy. A recent meta-analysis6 has shown that \\nalthough illness duration itself did not have a significant \\nimpact on sensitivity and specificity of the unimodal clas-\\nsification, older patients and chronic stage of illness were \\nsignificantly associated with higher sensitivity in RS fMRI \\ndata. These findings might result from more pronounced \\nFC alterations in older subjects with SZ as compared with \\nfirst-episode patients. The more pronounced FC altera-\\ntions have been previously shown in functional studies \\nthat reported a relationship between altered connectivity \\n(topological measurements) and illness duration in SZ.13\\nHowever, the majority of these multivariate pattern \\nanalysis (MVPA) studies used only 1 MRI modality to \\ndetermine the diagnostic membership of study partici-\\npants.14 Some of the recent multimodal imaging studies \\ninvestigating neuronal abnormalities in different MRI \\nmodalities came to a conclusion that multimodal fusion \\nis an effective approach to elucidate disease factors that \\nare shared across different modalities.15–17\\nHowever, more work needs to be done to explore fac-\\ntors determining the diagnostic performance of MRI-\\nbased biomarkers across the life span. Within this context, \\nthe first aim of this study was to thoroughly evaluate the \\nmoderating impact of sociodemographic and clinical vari-\\nables on the model generated by MRI-based classifiers.\\nPrevious studies have shown that integration of different \\nMRI modalities into multi-modal disease models may pro-\\nvide superior classification performance compared to each \\nof these single data channels alone.16,18–21 The potential \\nbenefit of combining different MRI modalities lies in the \\nincrease of the multivariate pattern classification perfor-\\nmance, as well as a broader insight into the neurobiological \\nprocesses underlying SZ. However, defining the optimal \\nway for combining information from different modalities \\nis challenging. Overfitting needs to be avoided and the \\nfusion process has to lead to disease classifiers that remain \\nrobust and operational even if 1 data channel is lost.12\\nWe hypothesized that the sociodemographic and clini-\\ncal moderators heavily determine the applicability of \\nmultimodal predictive models. Furthermore, we explored \\nthe hypothesis that longer duration of illness and higher \\nlevel of psychotic symptoms are paralleled by more pro-\\nnounced GM and FC abnormalities in patients.\\nMethods\\nParticipants\\nThe study included 74 HC and 71 SZ patients. Imaging \\nand phenotypic information was drawn from a Mind \\nResearch Network Center of Biomedical Research \\nExcellence (COBRE), funded by the National Institutes \\nof Health. This data is publicly available via the COINS \\ndata exchange (http://coins.mrn.org/dx).22 Detailed study \\nprocedures are described at http://cobre.mrn.org/. In \\nsummary, patients received the diagnosis of SZ by clini-\\ncal psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview \\nfor DSM-IV.\\nPsychopathological symptoms were rated using the \\nPositive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).23 The \\nantipsychotic medication at MRI scan was converted to \\nchlorpromazine and olanzapine equivalents (table 1).\\nAll subjects were screened and excluded if they had any \\nhistory of neurological disorder, history of mental retar-\\ndation, history of severe head trauma with more than 5 \\nminutes loss of consciousness, history of substance abuse \\nor dependence within the last 12 months. Informed con-\\nsent was obtained from all subjects according to insti-\\ntutional guidelines required by the Institutional Review \\nBoard at the University New Mexico (UNM).\\nData Acquisition and Preprocessing\\nAll participants were scanned on a 3 Tesla SIEMENS \\nTIM scanner with a 12-channel radio-frequency coil at \\nthe Mind Research Network. All the prepocessing steps \\nwere performed in the NeuroDiagnostic Applications \\ngroup of the Psychiatric Hospital of the LMU.\\nStructural Image Acquisition and Preprocessing\\nStructural images were obtained using a multi-echo \\nMPRAGE sequence with the following parameters: time \\nof repetition (TR) = 2530, echo time (TE) = (1.64, 3.5, \\n5.36, 7.22, 9.08), inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, flip angle \\n= 7°, field of view (FOV) 256 × 256 mm, slice thickness \\n= 176 mm, matrix size 256 × 256 × 176, voxel size 1 mm × \\n1 mm × 1 mm, Pixel band width 650 Hz. Structural MRI \\ndata were preprocessed using the VBM 8 toolbox (http://\\ndbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm8/), which was used to seg-\\nment the brain into white matter (WM), GM, and cerebral \\nspinal fluid (CSF). The VBM8 toolbox extends the uni-\\nfied segmentation model of SPM824 by the (1) application \\nof the Optimized Blockwise Nonlocal-Means Filter to \\nincrease the signal-to-noise ratio of the data,25 (2) segmen-\\ntation into GM, WM, and CSF using an adaptive maxi-\\nmum a posteriori approach26 extended by a partial volume \\nestimation model,27,28 and (3) post-processing using a hid-\\nden Markov Random Field model.29 This preprocessing \\nproduced modulated and GM segments were then nor-\\nmalized to MNI structural template using the DARTEL \\nalgorithm30 and re-sampled to 3 mm, isotropic resolution.\\nFunctional Image Acquisition and Preprocessing\\nBlood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) images of the \\nwhole brain using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence \\nwere acquired in 32 axial slices (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 29 ms, \\nflip angle =75°, FOV  =  24 cm, 3.5 mm thickness and \\n1.05 mm gap, matrix size= 64 × 64, voxel size 3.75 mm \\n× 3.75 mm × 4.55 mm) using the intercommissural line \\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS112\\nC.

RS scans resulted in 304 seconds \\nduration (152 volumes) and subjects were instructed to \\nkeep their eyes open during the scan and stare passively \\nat a foveally presented fixation cross, as this is suggested \\nto facilitate network delineation compared to eyes-closed \\nconditions and helps to ensure that subjects are awake.\\nFunctional RS data were processed as follows: First, \\nafter discarding the first 10 images (magnetization equi-\\nlibrium not reached) and 2 dummy scans, the remain-\\ning 140 images were unwarped and realigned to the \\nfirst volume for head-motion correction. Secondly, the \\ntime course of head motions was obtained by estimat-\\ning the translations in each direction and the rotations \\nin angular motion about each axis for each volume \\nusing SPM8, (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The \\nunwarped and realigned images underwent background \\nfiltering and exclusive masking of the cerebellum to \\naccount for the low signal to noise ratio in this brain \\nregion. Subsequently, temporal band-pass filtering \\n(0.01–0.08 Hz) was performed to reduce the effects of \\nlow-frequency drift and high-frequency noise using the \\nREST toolbox31 (http://restfmri.net/forum/REST). We \\nregressed out the global brain signal, mean white matter \\nsignal (0.9 threshold), mean CSF signal (0.7 threshold) \\nand the 6 motion parameters.\\nThen, the Montreal Neurological Institute struc-\\ntural template was high-dimensionally registered to each \\nsubject’s structural scan using the DRAMMS algorithm32 \\n(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dramms/), which encoded \\nlinear and nonlinear deformations in the template space \\nrelative to each individual’s subject space. Following a rigid \\nbody transformation (6 degrees of freedom) from the sub-\\nject’s structural image to the mean functional image, the 2 \\ntransformations were respectively applied to the template-\\nspace AAL atlas33 thus parcellating each subject’s series of \\nfunctional images using the warped AAL atlas. Then, the \\nmean time series in each of the 90 AAL regions was com-\\nputed by averaging voxel-level time series. The FC was then \\nestimated by calculating the mutual Information34 between \\nthe mean time series of each pair of brain regions for each \\nsubject (mutual information matrices; MIM).\\nWe decided to work in the original functional space in \\norder to avoid the reslicing of the functional images to a \\nhigher dimensional space.\\nMultivariate Pattern Classification Analysis\\nWe used our pattern recognition tool NeuroMiner \\n(http://www.pronia.eu/the-project/work-plan/wp2-\\nsurrogate-marker/) to implement a fully automated \\nmachine learning pipeline, which (1) constructed sets \\nof predictive neuroanatomical and neurofunctional fea-\\ntures from the high-dimensional GM maps and MIM \\nrespectively, and (2) learned decision rules from these \\nTable 1.

The remaining 13 subjects \\nwere used as independent validation set, meaning that \\nthese subjects were kept out of the model estimation pro-\\ncess and used as previously unseen data (table 1).\\nTo strictly separate the training process from the \\nevaluation of the predictor’s generalization capacity, \\nthe pipeline was completely embedded into a repeated \\ndouble cross-validation framework (rdCV).35 As previ-\\nously described, rdCV computes an unbiased estimate \\nof the method’s expected diagnostic accuracy on new \\ncases, rather than merely fitting the current study popu-\\nlation. Furthermore, rdCV produces classifier ensembles \\nthat separate single individuals from different groups, \\nwhile avoiding overfitting to the peculiarities of the \\ntraining data.\\nMore specifically, the following analysis steps were \\nwrapped into a 20-fold cross-validation cycle at the \\nouter (CV2) and a 20-fold cross-validation at the inner \\n(CV1) cycles of rdCV. Both MIM and GM maps were \\nscaled feature wise and for the GM maps, due to its \\ninherent high dimensionality, principal component \\nanalysis (PCA)36 was used to reduce feature dimen-\\nsionality. The principal components with the highest \\neigenvalues that cumulatively explained 80% of the \\nvariance were selected and the single subject GM maps \\nwere projected into the reduced principal components \\nspace. The resulting PC features (GM maps) and the \\nscaled MIM (FC) were, independently, fed to a linear \\nL2-regularized Logistic Regression (L2-LR) imple-\\nmented in the LIBLINEAR toolbox (http://www.csie.\\nntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/). The slack variable, C, was \\nestimated in the inner cycle of the cross validation, for \\nboth modalities independently.\\nFinally, unseen CV1 and CV2 test subjects, as well as \\nindividuals in the independent validation set were pro-\\ncessed by successively applying all training parameters \\nto the test data. The classifier determined a test sub-\\nject’s geometric position relative to the learned deci-\\nsion boundary, resulting in a group membership score \\nand predicted membership (determined by sign of the \\ngroup membership score). This analysis sequence was \\nrepeated for each CV1 training partition in a given \\nCV2 training fold, thus generating an ensemble classi-\\nfier which computed a CV2 test subject’s group mem-\\nbership by averaging the decision scores of its L2-LR \\nbase learners. Finally, for each subject, ensemble \\ngroup membership scores were averaged across those \\ntraining partitions, in which the subject had not been \\ninvolved in the training and optimization process, and \\nthus determining its final out-of-training (OOT) group \\nmembership score.\\nThe previously described classification procedure \\nwas applied independently to both GM maps and MIM \\nresulting, for each subject, in 2 OOT decision score, \\none based on the structural and one the fMRI data. \\nThe fusion of the data domains was then performed by \\ntaking the mean of the 2 OOT decision scores for each \\nsubject, resulting in a multi-modal class  membership \\nscore from which the multimodal class membership was \\nderived.\\nThe models described above were then applied to inde-\\npendent test data to further validate the method.\\nFor the clinical moderator analyses, a ν support \\nvector regression (ν-SVR) was applied to predict the \\nsingle modality OOT group membership scores based \\non clinical variables (table 1; for more details supple-\\nmentary materials table  3). The clinical analysis was \\nperformed on 62 SZ subjects with complete data sets. \\nSimilarly to the classification process an rdCV frame-\\nwork was employed to derive an unbiased estimation \\nof the method’s performance. For each CV2 fold the \\nfeatures were scaled, feature wise and a filter method, \\nthe Pearson correlation between the feature and the \\nlabel, was applied to filter uninformative features.37 The \\nselected scaled clinical features were used to predict \\nthe group membership scores with a ν-SVR as imple-\\nmented in LIBSVM with ν and C estimated in the inner \\ncycle of the CV framework.\\nResults\\nBoth functional and structural classifiers were able to dis-\\ntinguish between HC and SZ patients with similar accura-\\ncies. The GM classifier showed a slightly lower accuracy \\nof 69.7 % (P < .001; specificity 63.4% / sensitivity 82.4%) \\ncomparing to 70.5% accuracy of the RS classifier (speci-\\nficity 69.7% / sensitivity 71.2%).\\nThe accuracy for the OOCV dataset in the RS fMRI \\nwas 76.9 % (P = .09; specificity 62.5 % / specificity 100 %) \\nand 92.3 % (P = .003; specificity 87.5 % / sensitivity 100 \\n%) for the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI).\\nEnsemble-based data fusion outperformed pattern \\nclassification based on single MRI modalities by reach-\\ning 75 % accuracy classifier (P < .001; specificity 71.2% / \\nsensitivity 78.8%).\\nFor the OOCV data the fusion improved the classifica-\\ntion accuracy achieving for this dataset 100% accuracy \\n(P < .001).\\nStructural Analysis\\nThe structural pattern identified by the classifier (figure 1) \\nconsisted of (1) GM volume reductions in bilateral frontal, \\ntemporal, angular, supramarginal, insular, anterior cingu-\\nlate, parahippocampal, and postcentral cortices and bilateral \\nsubcortical structures (striatum and thalamus), and (2) GM \\nvolume increments in the cerebellum, as well as parietal and \\noccipital brain regions (supplementary materials table 1).\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS114\\nC.

Notably, frequently \\nselected demographic and clinical features were: current \\nage, age of the first psychotic symptoms, age at first psy-\\nchiatric illness, age at first psychiatric hospitalization, \\ndifficulty in abstract thinking, emotional withdrawal and \\nPANSS negative summary score.\\nDiscussion\\nThis study aimed to investigate potential effects of clini-\\ncal and sociodemographic variables on the performance \\nof neurodiagnostic classification. We initially confirmed \\nthat combination of GM and RS predictions outper-\\nformed pattern classification based on single MRI modal-\\nities by reaching 75% accuracy for this analysis compared \\nto ~70% accuracy for the single modalities. The appli-\\ncation of the proposed method to the independent test \\ndata resulted in accuracies near 100% this might be a \\nconsequence of the small size and demographic profile of \\nthis subsample, notably the age differences between the \\ngroups, young HC versus old SZ (table 1). Furthermore, \\nthe filter method employed as feature selection approach \\nin the regression helped us to identify the subset of the \\nclinical and demographic features that were most predic-\\ntive for the RS decision scores. The particular features \\nas patients’ current age and age of illness onset had the \\nhighest probability to be selected. Specifically, older \\nSZ patients with a later onset of illness and more pro-\\nnounced negative symptoms were more reliably assigned \\nto the SZ group by the RS classifier. Our findings about \\nmore pronounced changes in FC in older subjects with \\nSZ could be a result of accelerated „brain aging” in SZ,12 \\nas previous studies on normal aging already pointed out \\nat reduced FC in healthy elderly.38 Additionally, the age \\nof onset is an important predictor of SZ group member-\\nship as patients with a “later” age of illness onset, after \\nadolescence, seem to be characterized by greater FC defi-\\ncits. Previous MRI studies on biomarkers have shown \\nthat brain-specific deviations are dynamically related \\nto age and illness duration trajectories.13,39,40 For exam-\\nple, several studies showed that structural classifiers are \\nvery sensitive to age-related effects across the lifespan,12 \\nreporting accelerated „brain aging” in SZ putatively due \\nto dysmaturational processes in the early course of the \\nillness. The latest publications in the field are indicating \\nthat the acceleration is especially large in the first years \\nafter the disease onset.41 Though we were able to replicate \\nfindings from diverse studies that suggest GM changes in \\nSZ in a pattern involving both cortical and subcortical \\nstructures the structural classifier based on GM altera-\\ntions operated independently of sociodemographic and \\nclinical measures in our study. The reason could lie in \\nthe heterogeneous cohort that consist of many chronic \\nSZ Patients with different onset and duration of illness in \\nwhich the difference between chronological and the neu-\\nroanatomical age (brain age gap estimation [BrainAGE]) \\nmight be exhibiting ceiling effect.\\nIn the RS data domain it seems that the “later” illness \\nonset, after adolescence, may be responsible for the more \\nseverely disrupted FC in patients with SZ. This may not \\nbe reflecting the innate relationship between the FC and \\nage trajectories, but could be due to the fact that the later \\nonsets of illness are associated with older patients in our \\nsample.\\nMajority or aberrant connections in the SZ group were \\nsubcortical short range connections with a particular \\nemphasis on interhemispheric connections. This is not \\nsurprising considering that previous studies on inter-\\nhemispheric connectivity in SZ have shown evidence for \\nweakening of FC between the 2 brain hemispheres involv-\\ning a number of cortical and limbic regions.42 Aberrant \\nlong range connections of the SZ group in fronto-occipi-\\ntal, fronto-parietal,43 fronto-temporal9,44 and cortico-tha-\\nlamic regions45 were also embedded in the most predictive \\nset of functional features.\\n Importantly, the aberrant fronto-temporal connectiv-\\nity could explain the impaired recruitment of cognitive \\nverbal processing46 which contributes to negative symp-\\ntoms in the speech domain.47–49 Aberrant cortico-striatal \\nconnections have also been previously shown to be related \\nto negative symptoms of the SZ group.50\\nThe limitation of the study is that the chronic effects \\nof antipsychotics could contribute to the altered FC with \\nlonger duration of illness. Unfortunately, although the \\nsample contains information on the medication, we had \\nno information on “life time” medication. Importantly, \\nsuch chronic exposure to antipsychotic medication may \\nalso alter FC.51\\nOur results from the recent meta-analysis underline \\nthe utility of multivariate pattern recognition approaches \\ndespite the clinical heterogeneity of the SZ phenotype. \\nWe demonstrated that combination of sMRI and RS \\nfMRI provides even higher accuracy in discriminating \\nSZ patients from HC by optimizing deficiencies of single \\nmodality prediction. Furthermore, our finding on aber-\\nrant connectivity in SZ that starts in early adulthood \\nsupports the hypothesis that such psychopathological \\nabnormalities are paralleled by more pronounced brain \\nabnormalities which could be more easily detectable with \\nRS classifiers compared to structural classifiers.\\nFuture studies need to proceed further to identify clini-\\ncal variables that are relevant for the real-world applica-\\ntion, as well as for the clinical reliability of multivariate \\nmethods and novel therapeutical approaches.\\nSupplementary Material\\nSupplementary material is available at http://schizophre-\\nniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org.\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/suppl_1/S110/2413943 by guest on 18 March 2022\\nS116\\nC.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in US after cardiovascular disease. Image-based com-\\nputer-aided diagnosis can assist physicians to efficiently diagnose cancers in early stages. Existing computer-\\naided algorithms use hand-crafted features such as wavelet coefficients, co-occurrence matrix features, and\\nrecently, histogram of shearlet coefficients for classification of cancerous tissues and cells in images. These\\nhand-crafted features often lack generalizability since every cancerous tissue and cell has a specific texture,\\nstructure, and shape. An alternative approach is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the most\\nappropriate feature abstractions directly from the data and handle the limitations of hand-crafted features.\\nA framework for breast cancer detection and prostate Gleason grading using CNN trained on images along\\nwith the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients is presented. Particularly, we apply shearlet transform\\non images and extract the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients. Then we feed shearlet features\\nalong with the original images to our CNN consisting of multiple layers of convolution, max pooling, and\\nfully connected layers. Our experiments show that using the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients as\\nextra information to the network can improve the accuracy of detection and generalize better compared to\\nthe state-of-the-art methods that rely on hand-crafted features. This study expands the application of deep\\nneural networks into the field of medical image analysis, which is a difficult domain considering the limited\\nmedical data available for such analysis. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10.1117/1.JMI.3\\n.4.044501]\\nKeywords: microscopic images; prostate cancer; breast cancer; deep neural network; shearlet transform.\\nPaper 16119R received Jun. 21, 2016; accepted for publication Oct. 11, 2016; published online Nov. 3, 2016.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nIt is estimated that about 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will\\noccur in US during 2016.1 Prostate and breast cancers are the\\nsecond most dominant causes of death among cancers in\\nmales and females, respectively.1 Cancer cells can transfer to\\nother tissues and develop new tumors. Hence, it is vital to diag-\\nnose and grade cancer in early stages and provide necessary\\ntreatment. Histological analysis of tissue slides stained using\\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is the main approach for cancer\\ndetection and grading. This process involves a pathologist\\nexamining large areas of benign tissue to finally detect the\\nareas of malignancy. Therefore, cancer detection is very time-\\nconsuming and challenging. The Gleason grading system is\\nthe main approach for prostate grading,2 which classifies the\\nprostate cancer as grades 1 to 5 with increasing malignancy\\nas the grade increases. The Gleason score is calculated using\\nthe sum of the two most dominant Gleason grades inside a tissue\\nand ranges from 2 to 10. Patients with a combined score between\\n2 and 4 mostly survive while patients with a score of 8 to 10\\nhave a higher mortality rate.2 Automating the cancer diagnosis\\nand the grading process can reduce the time needed by pathol-\\nogists and remove the inter- and intraobserver variations.3\\nAutomated medical image classification is an important\\nresearch area which utilizes different feature detection and rep-\\nresentation techniques. These features can be classified into\\ntwo main categories: hand-crafted and learned features. Hand-\\ncrafted features are based on the pathologists’ approaches for\\ncancer diagnosis and grading. Pathologists scan tissue slides\\nand try to find symptoms of tumor progress including irregularly\\nshaped nuclei and lack of differentiation. Therefore, most of\\nautomated histological analysis methods first segment the cell\\nnuclei, then extract features from cell nuclei and use them\\nfor classification.4–6 For example, Boucheron et al.4 performed\\nimage segmentation on histopathology images of breast and\\nused the extracted features for breast cancer detection. Farjam\\net al.5 segmented the prostate glands and extracted structural fea-\\ntures from them and used them in a tree-structured algorithm for\\nautomatic Gleason grading of prostate. Stotzka et al.6 used fea-\\ntures extracted from cell nuclei along with neural networks for\\nautomatic grading of the prostate. Some other techniques that\\nused hand-crafted features are based on texture, color, and mor-\\nphological features.7–12 Jafari-Khouzani and Soltanian-Zadeh7\\nextracted energy and entropy from multiwavelets coefficients\\nand used them for the task of automatic Gleason grading of pros-\\ntate. They used the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to classify\\nimages. Tabesh et al.8 extracted color, texture, and morphomet-\\nric features from microscopic images of prostate and combined\\nthem and used them for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason\\ngrading. In an earlier study,9 we extracted features from multi-\\ndecomposition levels of shearlet filters and used the histogram\\nof shearlet coefficients (HSCs) for the task of classification of\\nbenign and malignant breast slides using support vector machine\\n*Address\\nall\\ncorrespondence\\nto:\\nHadi\\nRezaeilouyeh,\\nE-mail:\\nhadi.\\nrezaeilouyeh@du.edu\\n2329-4302/2016/$25.00 © 2016 SPIE\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-1\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nJournal of Medical Imaging 3(4), 044501 (Oct–Dec 2016)\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\n(SVM) and achieved 75% classification accuracy. We also used\\nHSC for prostate cancer detection of histological images10 and\\nmagnetic resonance (MR) images11 and achieved 100% and\\n97% classification accuracy, respectively. In a recent study,12\\nwe extracted multiple features from the histological images of\\nprostate cancer and used the multiple kernel learning (MKL)\\nalgorithm for fusing the features. Then we used SVM equipped\\nwith MKL for the classification of prostate slides with different\\nGleason grades.\\nMost of the methods mentioned above merge different hand-\\ncrafted features to represent the texture of histopathology\\nimages. These methods usually include some preprocessing\\n(e.g., segmentation) and the final classification result depends\\non the accuracy of the previous steps. In addition, these hand-\\ncrafted features are designed for a specific type of problem.\\nIt is time-consuming to design a new set of features and they\\nare not easily applicable on different datasets. Furthermore,\\nsome of these hand-crafted features have inherent limitations\\nthat make them less efficient for complex tasks. A good example\\nwould be the wavelet transform, which has been widely used for\\ndifferent applications including cancer diagnosis and grading.5–8\\nWavelets do not have directional sensitivity, which makes them\\nunsuitable for detecting directional features. That was the\\nmotive for using shearlets instead of wavelets in our previous\\nstudies9–12 and in this paper as well. On the other hand, recent\\nfeature learning methods have gained a lot of attention due to the\\nsuccess of deep neural networks methods in computer vision\\napplications. The advances in computational power and the\\navailability of large training databases also played an important\\nrole in the development of deep neural networks.13 Deep learn-\\ning (DL) is a subset of machine learning models that represents\\nhigh-level abstractions extracted directly from images using\\nnonlinear transformations.13,14 The main advantage of DL meth-\\nods is their ability to form hierarchical representations of data by\\nderiving higher level features from lower level features using\\nnonlinear processing units.13 Therefore, despite hand-crafted\\nfeatures, learned features do not need any preprocessing and\\ncan easily be transferred to different applications since they are\\ndata-driven.15 These methods often outperform traditional\\napproaches that use hand-crafted features.16–19 Cruz-Roa et al.15\\nproposed a three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN)\\nmethod for invasive ductal carcinoma detection in histopathol-\\nogy images of breast cancer and compared their method with\\nhand-crafted features. They reported 6% improvement in the\\nclassification accuracy when using their CNN. Liao et al.16 pro-\\nposed a stacked-independent subspace analysis DL framework\\nfor prostate T2 MR image segmentation. They reported 3%\\nimprovement in segmentation accuracy when using their DL\\nframework. Couture et al.17 proposed a sparse coding-based\\nhierarchical feature learning method for breast cancer detection\\nin histopathology images. They were able to increase the clas-\\nsification accuracy by 6% using their proposed feature learning\\nmethod. Cireşan et al.18 presented a DL method based on max\\npooling for mitosis detection in histology images of breast\\ncancer. They won the International Conference on Pattern\\nRecognition 2012 competition. Li et al.19 used shearlet trans-\\nform and deep neural networks for image quality assessment.\\nThey extracted features using the sum of subband shearlet coef-\\nficients and used stacked autoencoders as their main neural net-\\nwork building blocks. They used a softmax classifier to assess\\nthe quality of images in their dataset. In this paper, we propose a\\nshearlet-based deep neural network method for breast cancer\\ndetection and Gleason grading of prostate. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the first time that shearlet transform and\\nDL are employed together for medical image classification.\\nOur main contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we\\npropose using the phase of shearlet coefficients as a primary fea-\\nture for general purpose microscopic medical image classifica-\\ntion. This is the first study that utilizes the phase of shearlets for\\nsuch applications. Shearlet transform20 is a directional multi-\\nscale representation system with affine properties which can\\ndetect anisotropic features at different orientations and scales.\\nMost of the signal’s information is carried by the phase21 and\\nthe phase features are invariant to noise and image contrast.22\\nHowever, since the phase information is nontrivial, it is difficult\\nto design and hand-craft phase features that work as a general\\napproach. This motivated us to further improve our proposed\\nmethod as follows. Second, we add the magnitude of shearlet\\ncoefficients and the RGB images to the phase features. The mag-\\nnitude of shearlet coefficients is a direct representative of the\\nsingularities in the image and the higher the magnitude, the\\nhigher the possibility of an edge occurring in that location.23\\nThe reason to include the RGB images is in the nature of\\nthis problem. Since these images are H&E stained, the color\\ninformation is very important for breast cancer detection and\\nGleason grading. As cancer happens and the grade increases,\\nthe cell nuclei (stained blue) become larger and the cytoplasm\\narea (stained pink) shrinks. Therefore, we need to consider color\\ninformation as one of our primary features as well. Third, we\\npropose a deep neural network as an evolution process to\\nexplore the aforementioned features (phase and magnitude of\\nshearlet coefficients and RGB images) and use them for cancer\\ndetection and Gleason grading. Our CNN consists of multiple\\nlayers of convolutions followed by max pooling along with fully\\nconnected and dropout layers. In summary, our contributions are\\nlisted below:\\n• Utilize phase of shearlet coefficients as a primary feature\\nfor microscopic medical image classification.\\n• Empower magnitude of shearlet coefficients and RGB\\nimages to support the phase features.\\n• Employ deep neural networks to explore the shearlet-\\nbased image representations and RGB images and learn\\nfeatures for image classification.\\nThe proposed framework for microscopic medical image\\nclassification is presented in Fig. 1. The remainder of this\\npaper is organized as follows. The proposed framework consist-\\ning of shearlet transform and CNN is presented in Sec. 2. In\\nSec. 3, the experimental setup and results along with the analysis\\nof the proposed framework are presented in detail. Finally in\\nSec. 4, discussions and conclusions are presented.\\n2\\nMethodology\\nProstate Gleason grading and breast cancer detection are mainly\\nbased on texture features and characteristics of cancerous tissues\\nas shown in Fig. 2. It is noticeable that as the Gleason grade\\nincreases [Fig. 2(b)], the texture becomes more detailed and\\nthe epithelial cell nuclei grow in a random manner and spread\\nacross the tissue. Therefore, we need an accurate and robust tex-\\nture analysis technique. For this purpose, we propose to extract\\nour primary features from microscopic images using magnitude\\nand phase of shearlet coefficients and evolve these features\\nusing DL techniques to make them more discriminative.

Despite its predecessors, e.g.,\\ncurvelet25 where the direction is defined using rotation, shearlet\\ndefines the direction using shearing matrices, which makes\\nthe discrete implementation of shearlets easier and also makes\\nthe shearlet rotation-invariant.\\nThe continuous shearlet transform20 is defined as the map-\\nping for fϵR2\\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e001;63;131SHΨfða; s; tÞ ≤ f; Ψa;s;t >;\\na > 0; sεR; tεR2;\\n(1)\\nwhere the shearlets are defined as the following:\\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e002;63;88Ψa;s;tðxÞ ¼ j det Ma;sj−1\\n2ΨðM−1\\na;sx − tÞ;\\n(2)\\nwhere Ma;s ¼\\n� a\\nﬃﬃﬃa\\np s\\n0\\nﬃﬃﬃa\\np\\n�\\n¼ BsAa, where Aa ¼\\n� a\\n0\\n0\\nﬃﬃﬃa\\np\\n�\\n,\\nand Bs ¼\\n� 1\\ns\\n0\\n1\\n�\\n. Ma;s is the multiplication of an anisotropic\\ndilation matrix (Aa) and a shearing matrix ( Bs), which makes\\nthe shearlets well localized. By incorporating the translation,\\nscale, and shear parameters, shearlet is able to detect directional\\nsingularities and geometrical features of multidimensional data.\\nA recent implementation of shearlets called “fast finite\\nshearlet transform” (FFST)24 uses fast Fourier transform for\\ndiscrete implementation of shearlets in the frequency domain\\nand consequently produces complex shearlet coefficients. Since\\nwe wanted to extract the phase of shearlet coefficients, we\\nutilized this implementation of shearlets in this paper. The\\nphase along with the magnitude of shearlet coefficients is then\\nfed to a deep neural network for automatic Gleason grading and\\nbreast cancers diagnosis.\\nShearlet has some interesting mathematical properties.26,27\\nShearlets are well localized; they are compactly supported in\\nthe frequency domain. They have parabolic scaling and each\\nelement of shearlets is supported on a pair of trapezoids. They\\nhave high directional sensitivity. Shearlets are spatially localized\\nFig. 2 Prostate tissue samples with different Gleason grade: (a) grade 2 and (b) grade 5.\\nFig. 1 Block diagram of our proposed framework consisting of the training and test phases.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-3\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nand optimally sparse. To summarize, shearlets form a tight frame\\nof well-localized waveforms at different scales and directions\\nand are optimally sparse for representing edges in the images.\\nThese properties make the shearlet a well-suited tool for\\ndetecting singularities in different cancerous tissues in micro-\\nscopic images.\\n2.2\\nFeatures Extracted from Shearlet Transform\\nThe success of a classification framework highly depends on\\nthe choice of the feature representation method. In this paper,\\nwe are interested in microscopic image classification, especially\\nin prostate Gleason grading and breast cancer diagnosis. Taking\\nanother look at Fig. 2 highlights the changes that a tissue cell\\ngoes through when the Gleason grade increases. As the Gleason\\ngrade increases, epithelial cells randomly duplicate, disturbing\\nthe normal structure of glands.4 The higher grade cells are\\ndescribed by irregular morphology in nuclei, larger nuclei, and\\nless cytoplasm than lower grades as shown in Fig. 2. A similar\\nprocess happens to breast tissue when cancer develops. To re-\\npresent these textural and morphological properties of the can-\\ncerous tissues, we apply the shearlet transform on microscopic\\nimages and extract magnitude and phase of complex shearlet\\ncoefficients and use them as our primary features. To better illus-\\ntrate the effectiveness of the shearlet transform for microscopic\\nimage classification, we show benign and malignant breast tis-\\nsue images along with their corresponding magnitude and phase\\nof shearlet coefficients from a single subband in Fig. 3.

This effect is more\\nobvious in the magnitude of shearlet coefficients compared to\\nthe phase of shearlet coefficients. This is because the magnitude\\nof shearlet coefficients is a direct representative of the singular-\\nities in the image and the higher the magnitude, the higher the\\npossibility of an edge occurring in that location.23 One way to\\nrepresent statistical properties of shearlet coefficients is to\\nextract histograms from the magnitude of shearlet coefficients.\\nWe previously used HSCs for breast cancer detection9 and pros-\\ntate cancer detection11 and Gleason grading.10,12 Figure 4 shows\\nthe histogram of magnitude of shearlet coefficients for two\\ncases. Figure 4(a) shows the HSCs for a pair of benign and\\nmalignant images, where they were correctly classified. The\\nshape and peaks of histograms are different for benign and\\nmalignant images. Figure 4(b) shows a failed case where the\\nimages were incorrectly classified using the HSC method.\\nThe shape and the peaks of the histograms are very similar. One\\npossible reason is that the histogram does not include any infor-\\nmation on the local structure of the images.\\nThe importance of phase in image processing and computer\\nvision has been investigated in previous studies.28–22 It was veri-\\nfied that most of the signal’s information is carried by the\\nphase21 and in some cases only the phase is enough to recon-\\nstruct a signal.28 Also, the phase features are invariant to noise\\nand image contrast.22 However, since the phase information is\\nnontrivial, it is difficult to design and hand-craft phase features\\nthat work as a general approach. For example, the histogram of\\nphase features does not sufficiently represent the changes in the\\ntexture of an image since, despite magnitude, the phase does not\\ndirectly relate to strong edges. This motivated us to add the\\nphase information to the magnitude and learn features instead\\nof hand-crafting them in this paper. We extract the magnitude\\nand phase of shearlet coefficients as follows.\\nAssume we denote a complex shearlet coefficient by\\ncða; s; tÞ ¼ x þ iy, where x and y are the real and imaginary\\nparts of a complex shearlet coefficient and a, s, and t are the scale,\\nshear, and translation parameters of the shearlet transform, respec-\\ntively. We use the following equations to extract the magnitude\\n[magða; s; tÞ] and the phase [phaseða; s; tÞ] of the coefficients\\nEQ-TARGET;temp:intralink-;e003;63;119\\nmagða; s; tÞ ¼ jcða; s; tÞj ¼\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nx2 þ y2\\nq\\nphaseða; s; tÞ ¼ ∡½cða; s; tÞ� ¼ tan−1�y\\nx\\n�\\n:\\n(3)\\nAfter we extracted the above features from each subband of\\nthe shearlets, then we feed them to our deep neural network as\\nexplained in Sec. 2.3.\\n2.3\\nConvolutional Neural Networks and Feature\\nLearning\\nOur primary features are magnitude and phase of shearlet coef-\\nficients along with RGB data. As we previously explained,\\nhand-crafting the features is not a suitable method for complex\\ntasks (e.g., medical image analysis, where important clinical fea-\\ntures are used to represent objects such as cell nuclei). There-\\nfore, in the following, we propose our automatic feature learning\\nmethod based on deep neural networks.\\nTraditional machine learning methods have limited abilities\\nto analyze natural data that are represented in their raw form.\\nThis is due to the fact that shallow classifiers need appropriate\\nfeature extraction and representation techniques, which are sen-\\nsitive to the discriminative attributes of the input while invariant\\nto unimportant features (selectivity–invariance dilemma).29 On\\nthe other hand, DL methods29–32 consist of multiple processing\\nlayers to learn representations directly from raw data with multi-\\nple levels of abstraction.29 For an image, the lower levels of\\nabstraction might correspond to the edges in the image, while\\nhigher abstraction layers correspond to the objects in the image.\\nCNNs30 are feed-forward networks consisting of consecutive\\npairs of convolutional and pooling layers along with fully\\nconnected layers. They are especially designed for inputs rep-\\nresented as 2-D data (e.g., images). The input data first go\\nthrough pairs of convolution and pooling layers. Convolution\\nlayers apply 2-D convolution on their inputs using rectangular\\nfilters, which are applied in different positions of the input. The\\nconvolution layer sums the responses from previous layer, adds\\na bias term, and drives the result through a nonlinear activation\\nfunction. This process is repeated with different weights to cre-\\nate multiple feature maps. The output of the convolutional layer\\nthen usually passes through a pooling layer, which is a down-\\nsampling technique and results in translation-invariant features.\\nAfter a few pairs of convolution and pooling layers, one or more\\nfully connected layers combine the outputs into a feature vector.\\nThe final layer is a fully connected layer with one neuron per\\nclass (two for breast cancer diagnosis and four for Gleason grad-\\ning), which are activated by a softmax classifier. Throughout the\\nwhole process, the weights are optimized by minimizing the\\nmisclassification error using stochastic gradient descent method.\\nFig. 4 HSCs for (a) correctly classified benign and malignant pair, and (b) incorrectly classified pair.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-5\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nThe building blocks of our proposed deep neural network are\\npresented in Fig. 5. Figure 6 shows the architecture of our CNN.\\nThe description of each layer in our CNN is presented in the\\nfollowing:\\n1. Convolutional layer (conv): This layer applies a 2-D con-\\nvolution on the input feature maps using 64 Gaussian\\nfilters of size 5 × 5 initialized with a standard deviation\\nof 0.0001 and bias of zero. It steps 2 pixels between\\neach filter application. The output then goes through a\\nnonlinear rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, which\\nis defined as fðzÞ ¼ maxðz; 0Þ.

The inputs are RGB images, magnitude of shearlet\\ncoefficients from decomposition levels 1 to 5 (Mag1 to Mag5), and phase of shearlet coefficients from\\ndecomposition levels 1 to 5 (Phase1 to Phase5). Then they go through separate CNNs and the results\\nare concatenated using a fully connected layer, which sends the final evolved features to softmax for\\nclassification.\\nFig. 6 Architecture of our CNN. The input is a 120 × 120 patch and can be either RGB or magnitude or\\nphase of shearlet coefficients. Then three layers of convolution and pooling are applied on the input back\\nto back to extract abstracts from the input. Finally, a fully connected layer combines the outputs of\\nconvolution filters and sends out a single feature vector with the size of 64.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-6\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nif a linear function was used, the entire network would\\nbe equivalent to a single-layer neural network.\\n2. Max-pooling layer: The purpose of the pooling layer is\\nto combine similar features into one; therefore, it is\\na feature dimension reduction technique. It calculates\\nthe maximum of a local patch of units inside a 3 × 3\\nregion of input feature map and steps 2 pixels between\\npooling regions.

Fully connected layer: Also known as inner product\\nthis is one of the top layers of a CNN architecture. It\\nconnects all the neurons in the previous layer to all the\\nneurons it has. It does not have any spatial informa-\\ntion. It takes the output of pooling layers as input\\nand combines them into a feature vector, similar to\\na multilayer perceptron network.\\n5.

Classification layer: The final layer of CNN is a fully\\nconnected layer with one neuron per class (two for\\nbreast cancer diagnosis and four for Gleason grading),\\nwhich is activated by the softmax classifier. Given the\\ntraining labels, it gives the accuracy of the classification.\\n3\\nExperiments and Results\\nIn this section, first we describe our data preprocessing in detail.\\nThen we explain our feature extraction using shearlets transform\\nand CNN structure and parameters. Finally, we present our\\nresults and compare them with the state-of-the-art methods\\nbased on hand-crafted features.\\n3.1\\nDatasets and Data Preparation\\nWe used two microscopic medical imaging datasets for our\\nexperiments. The first set was the University of California,\\nSanta Barbara Biosegmentation Benchmark dataset.34 This data-\\nset contained 58 H&E-stained histopathology images of breast\\ntissue. Out of 58 total images, there were 26 malignant images\\nand 32 benign images. The second dataset was the prostate\\nGleason grading dataset used by Jafari-Khouzani and Soltanian-\\nZadeh.7 This dataset contained 100 H&E images of prostate\\ntissue samples. The images were of grades 2 to 5 and the mag-\\nnification was 100 with different sizes. All of the images were\\ncaptured in equal conditions of light. This dataset contained 21,\\n20, 32, and 27 images of grades 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\\nEach image had a single grade. The images were graded by\\nexpert pathologists who provided the ground truth data.\\nSince our CNN experiments needed a large amount of data,\\nwe augmented both datasets. For this purpose, we performed\\nmirroring, patches, rotation, and scaling of the images. For\\nmirroring, we used three mirroring scenarios (horizontal, verti-\\ncal, and horizontal and vertical). For rotation, we rotated each\\nimage 10 times with a rotation randomly chosen between 10 deg\\nand 90 deg. For scaling, we resized each image by a factor of 2.\\nFor extracting patches out of images, we extracted them from\\ntop left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, and center of the\\nimage, each half the size of the original image. We also com-\\nbined the above operations to further augment the datasets.\\nOverall, we were able to augment each original image to 104\\nimages. Therefore, we had 6032 augmented breast tissue images\\nand 10,400 augmented prostate tissue images. Throughout this\\nwhole process, since we had different size images, we resized\\nthe images to 128 × 128 pixels for normalization purposes.\\nFigure 7 shows all 104 augmented images of a sample breast\\ntissue image.\\n3.2\\nExperimental Setup\\nWe had two types of primary features. One was the RGB\\nimages, which were extracted as explained in Sec. 3.1. The\\nother primary features were shearlet features, which were\\nextracted as explained next.\\n3.2.1\\nShearlet feature extraction\\nTo apply shearlet transform on images, we utilized the FFST\\nMATLAB® toolbox provided by Häuser and Steidl.24 We\\nchose five scales (decomposition levels) for shearlet. The first\\ndecomposition level was a low-pass filtered version of input.\\nWe chose eight directions for the second and third levels and\\n16 directions for the fourth and fifth levels which led to 8, 8,\\n16, and 16 subbands, respectively. Therefore, overall we had\\n1 þ 8 þ 8 þ 16 þ 16 ¼ 49 subbands of shearlets. All these sub-\\nbands were of the same size as the input image (150 × 150). We\\nfollowed the procedure explained in Sec. 3.1 to extract the\\nmagnitude [magða; s; tÞ] and phase [phaseða; s; tÞ] of shearlet\\ncoefficients from each subband and fed them to our CNN\\nframework.\\n3.2.2\\nConvolutional neural networks framework and\\nfeature evolution\\nAs\\nwe\\nexplained\\nin\\nSec.\\n2.3,\\nour\\nCNN\\nconsisted\\nof\\nthree layers of convolution and max-pooling. For convolutional\\nlayers, we initialized 64 Gaussian filters of size 5 × 5 with a\\nstandard deviation of 0.0001 and bias of zero. The step between\\neach filter application was 2 pixels. We used an ReLU function\\nas the activation function. For max-pooling layer, we applied it\\non local patch of units inside a 3 × 3 region of input feature map\\nwith a 2 pixels step between pooling regions. We used an LRN\\nlayer to normalize local input regions. We used fully connected\\nlayers for concatenating the outputs of CNNs.\\nWe used the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with the\\nmomentum of 0.9 and the weight decay of 0.05 in all experi-\\nments. We used mini-batches of 32 samples due to the large\\nsize of the network and the memory limitations. All models\\nwere initialized with the learning rate of 0.001. These hyper-\\nparameters were empirically found based on the performance\\nof validation set over onefold of Gleason grading. The same\\nhyperparameters were used for the breast cancer experiment.\\nWe also used dropout layers to prevent the overfitting of the\\nresults to the structure of the CNN. The dropout threshold value\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-7\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nof 0.7 was found to be the best based on the classification accu-\\nracy on validation set.\\nOur primary input features were RGB, magnitude, and phase\\nof shearlet coefficients. Figure 5 shows the overall structure of\\nour deep neural network. Mag1 to Mag5 were the magnitude of\\nshearlet coefficients from decomposition levels 1 to 5, respec-\\ntively. Phases 1 to 5 were the phase of shearlet coefficients from\\ndecomposition level 1 to 5, respectively. We fed each one of our\\ninputs (RGB, Mag1 to Mag5, and phases 1 to 5) to a separate\\nCNN. The reason for separating RGB from shearlet data was\\nbecause they were of a different nature and, therefore, needed\\nseparate processing. We separated the magnitude and phase of\\nshearlets for the same reason. We also processed shearlet coef-\\nficients from different decomposition levels independently\\nbecause different decomposition levels represent features from\\ndifferent scales.\\nFigure 8 visualizes the shearlet feature evolution as they go\\nthrough each convolutional layer. Figures 8(a) and 8(b) show the\\nfirst convolution layer output features for the first and third\\ndecomposition level shearlet coefficients, respectively. The third\\ndecomposition level shearlet coefficients represent more details\\nin the images with more directional sensitivity. Figures 8(c) and\\n8(d) show the same shearlet coefficients out of the second con-\\nvolution. After the second convolution, the features become\\nmore distinguishable.\\n3.3\\nResults\\nWe evaluated our proposed microscopic image classification\\nframework for two tasks: breast cancer diagnosis and prostate\\nGleason grading. Although both tasks contain similar input data\\n(H&E images), they are different in nature. One is to distinguish\\ncancerous from noncancer cells, while the other (i.e., Gleason\\ngrading) is to evaluate how advanced the cancer is. Also,\\nthey belong to different human tissues, therefore, the physiologi-\\ncal and textural information are different. We evaluated our\\nmethod against these different tasks to show the generality\\nand applicability of our method.\\nFor each classification task, RGB images and extracted\\nshearlet features from input images were fed to our CNN frame-\\nwork with the parameters explained in Sec. 3.2.2. For cross val-\\nidation, we used a fivefold cross-validation technique. We\\ndivided our original datasets (nonaugmented) into five sets\\nand used four sets for training and one for testing. We repeated\\nthis five times and reported the average classification accuracy.\\nWe used the augmentation process during the training. The final\\nnetwork is evaluated on the original images only. Therefore, all\\nimages pertaining to a given case are either in the training or test\\nset (not in both). We had three different scenarios for CNN\\nexperiments. In the first scenario, we used only RGB data as\\ninput. In the second scenario, we combined RGB and magnitude\\nof shearlets and used them as input. Lastly, we combined RGB,\\nmagnitude, and phase of shearlets and used them as input to\\nCNN. This helped us understand the contribution of each feature\\nset separately and when combined together. We were able to\\nsignificantly increase the classification accuracy (by 13% for\\nbreast cancer diagnosis and 8% for Gleason grading) by com-\\nbining RGB and magnitude of shearlets. We further improved\\nthe results by including phase information as well. To evaluate\\nthe performance of our deep neural network, we compared the\\nresults with the state-of-the-art methods based on hand-crafted\\nfeatures using SVM. For SVM, we tried different kernels (linear,\\npolynomial, and RBF) with different parameters (polynomial\\norder of 1, 2, and 3 for polynomial kernel and sigma values\\nFig. 7 Augmented images of a sample breast tissue image from our dataset.\\nJournal of Medical Imaging\\n044501-8\\nOct–Dec 2016 • Vol. 3(4)\\nRezaeilouyeh, Mollahosseini, and Mahoor: Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning. . .\\nDownloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Medical-Imaging on 18 Mar 2022\\nTerms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\\nbetween 1 and 10,000 for Gaussian radial basis function kernel)\\nand chose the best kernel and parameters for each experiment.\\nOur experiments showed that CNN outperforms the hand-\\ncrafted feature extraction methods.\\nTable 1 shows the classification results for breast cancer\\ndiagnosis using our deep neural network method and state-of-\\nthe-art methods.

In addition, using hand-crafted feature extraction meth-\\nods,7 there are some misclassifications between grades 4 and 3\\nin addition to grades 4 and 5, which proves the advantage of\\nour method.\\n4\\nDiscussions and Conclusions\\nEarly diagnosis of cancer and grading its severity are very\\nimportant tasks that can save a patients’ life. Automating this\\nprocess can help pathologists to have a faster and more reliable\\ndiagnosis. Most of the automatic cancer diagnosis and grading\\ntechniques use hand-crafted features that need to be fine-tuned\\nfor different tasks.\\nIn this paper, we proposed a framework for automatic breast\\ncancer detection and prostate Gleason grading. First, we\\nextracted the magnitude and phase of complex shearlet coeffi-\\ncients from the histological images. Shearlet transform is a mul-\\ntiscale directional system that has proven itself suitable for\\ntexture analysis of microscopic images in our previous studies.\\nThen we combined the shearlet features with imagery data and\\nused them to train CNNs. This feature learning process further\\nenhanced the features and made them more discriminative. Then\\nwe used softmax classifier to distinguish different microscopic\\nimages. We were able to achieve high-classification accuracy on\\nboth breast cancer and Gleason grading datasets using our pro-\\nposed method. We also compared our method against state-of-\\nthe-art methods that use hand-crafted features. We were able to\\noutperform those methods in both cases.\\nOne of the main advantages of our method is that it does not\\nmake any assumptions beforehand about the visual features of\\ncancerous tissues. We consider shearlet transform as a general\\nmathematical tool and extract features without any hand-craft-\\ning. Our deep neural network takes care of the feature learning\\ntask. Future work includes exploring the possibility of using\\ndeeper architectures for CNN and also expanding the applica-\\ntions of our method to different medical image analysis tasks.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis research was supported by the National Science Founda-\\ntion with Grant No. IIP-1230556.

It commonly arises in patients with established liver disease and \\nthe diagnosis often occurs at an advanced stage. Genetic variations, such as single \\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may alter disease risk and thus may have use \\nas predictive markers of disease outcome. The aims of this study were (i) to assess \\nthe association of two SNPs, rs430397 in GRP78 and rs738409 in PNPLA3 with the \\nrisk of developing HCC in a Sicilian association cohort and, (ii) to use a machine \\nlearning technique to establish a predictive combinatorial phenotypic model for HCC \\nincluding rs430397 and rs738409 genotypes and clinical and laboratory attributes. \\nThe controls comprised of 304 healthy subjects while the cases comprised of 170 HCC \\npatients the majority of whom had hepatitis C (HCV)–related cirrhosis. Significant \\nassociations were identified between the risk of developing HCC and both rs430397 \\n(p=0.0095) and rs738409 (p=0.0063). The association between rs738409 and HCC \\nwas significantly stronger in the HCV positive cases. In the best prediction model, \\nrepresented graphically by a decision tree with an acceptable misclassification rate of \\n17.0%, the A/A and G/A genotypes of the rs430397 variant were fixed and combined \\nwith the three rs738409 genotypes; the attributes were age, sex and alcohol. These \\nresults demonstrate significant associations between both rs430397 and rs738409 and \\nHCC development in a Sicilian cohort. The combinatorial predictive model developed \\nto include these genetic variants may, if validated in independent cohorts, allow for \\nearlier diagnosis of HCC.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most \\ncommon of the primary liver cancers. It is the fifth most \\ncommon malignancy worldwide and the third most frequent \\ncause of cancer-related deaths [1–3]. The epidemiology of \\nHCC is complex reflecting, to a large extent, differences \\nin levels of exposure to known predisposing factors \\nsuch as the presence of cirrhosis, chronic infection \\nwith hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus \\n(HCV) and environmental toxin exposure. Prevalence \\nrates are 16 to 32 times higher in economically less- \\n                  Research Paper\\nOncotarget\\n86792\\nwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\\ndeveloped countries such as sub-Saharan Africa South-east \\nAsia and China [4]. In Eastern Asia the major risk factor \\nfor HCC is infection with hepatitis B [5, 6], whereas in \\nNorthern and Western Europe excess alcohol consumption \\nand infection with HCV are the main antecedents [3]. In \\ndeveloped countries HCC develops most frequently in \\npatients with established cirrhosis whereas elsewhere HCC \\nmay arise in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection \\nat a pre-cirrhotic stage [7, 8]. There are also data to support \\na role for tobacco smoking, diabetes and obesity as risk \\nfactors or risk co-factors for the development of HCC [9]. \\nFinally there are important gender differences in HCC \\nprevalence; men are at two- to five-fold increased risk of \\ndeveloping this malignancy than women, depending on \\ngeographic area, which most likely reflect their increased \\nexposures to known risk factors [1].\\nAs the epidemiology of HCC has become better \\nunderstood, so has the fact that only 5 to 20% of the \\npopulations potentially at risk actually develop HCC. \\nInterest has, therefore, turned to the identification of \\nthe factors responsible for the differences in individual \\nsusceptibility; in particular the role of genetic variation. \\nTwo of the most notable genetic findings to date have \\nbeen the association between the Single Nucleotide \\nPolymorphisms (SNP), rs430397 and rs738409, with HCC \\nrisk. The rs430397 variant in glucose regulated protein \\n78 (GRP78 also known as HSPA5) has been associated \\nwith HCC and cirrhosis risk in Chinese populations with \\nHBV infection [10, 11]. There is considerable functional \\nand genetic evidence implicating the GRP78 protein in \\nmechanisms of HCC carcinogenesis [12, 13] and indeed in \\nmalignancies at other sites [14, 15]. The rs738409 variant in \\npatatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) \\nhas been identified as conferring a significant risk for \\ndeveloping cirrhosis in relation to non-alcohol-related fatty \\nliver disease [16] and alcohol-related liver disease [17]. \\nThe rs738409 variant not only contributes to liver injury, \\nbut also to the risk of development of subsequent HCC [18, \\n19]. The nature of the association between the rs738409 \\nvariant in HCV-related HCC is less well characterized \\nthan in HCC of other aetiologies possibly because there is \\nsignificant heterogeneity in the study populations in which \\nthis variant has been studied [20].\\nVariants in GRP78 and PNPLA3 have been \\nassociated with HCC risk in populations of diverse \\nancestry and with HCC of diverse aetiology. It is not \\nknown, however what proportion of the variance in \\nHCC risk can be attributed to genetic factors in Southern \\nEuropean populations in whom the main risk factor for \\nthe development of HCC is chronic HCV infection and \\nthe incidence is rising [9]. Further, it is widely recognized \\nthat HCC risk prediction in chronic liver disease will have \\nclinical utility in guiding evidence-based decisions about \\npatient management [21] but it is unclear as to whether \\ngenetic information could improve the predictive models. \\nMachine learning techniques have the potential to improve \\nthe accuracy of predictive models using genetic data [22]. \\nA number of machine learning techniques have been \\ndeveloped, but all make use of computer algorithms that \\nimprove predictive accuracy with experience. Decision \\ntree algorithms in particular are a well-established \\ntechnique, which are useful for exploratory analysis and \\nmodel visualisation.\\nThe aims of the present study were therefore to \\nassess, whether (i) two genetic variants in PNPLA3 and \\nGRP78 are associated with the risk of developing HCC \\nin a Sicilian population, and (ii) whether inclusion of \\ngenotypic information would contribute to a predictive \\nmodel designed to stratify patients by HCC risk.\\nRESULTS\\nCohort characteristics\\nThe cases were significantly older than the healthy \\ncontrols (mean ± 1SD age 70.2± 8.0 vs. 56.6 ± 8.1 years; \\np = 2.2 x 10-16) and comprised of proportionately fewer \\nmen (70.4% vs. 58.2%, p = 0.007) (Table 1). All but one \\nof the cases had established cirrhosis; in the majority \\nchronic HCV infection was the aetiological agent (Table \\n1). A small proportion of patients (n=12; 7%), had marked \\nsteatosis in addition to cirrhosis. Up to 40% of the cases \\nhad experienced a major complication of chronic liver \\ndisease; and the majority had features of hepatocellular \\ndysfunction with poor synthetic and excretory function \\n(Table 2). Features of cirrhosis were evident on imaging in \\nall included cases; ultrasonography was the modality most \\nfrequently employed (Table 2). The diagnosis of HCC was \\nmade in the majority on the basis of multimodal imaging; \\nless than a quarter of patients had an elevated serum alpha-\\nfetoprotein level (Table 3).\\nGenotyping quality\\nThe genotyping success rate was greater than 95% \\nfor both variants, with genotype distributions showing no \\nevidence for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in \\ncontrols (p >0.05). The minor and major allele designations \\nof both rs430397 and rs738409 were generally similar in \\nthis Sicilian ancestry cohort to those in reference Europeans \\nancestry groups [23]; however, the minor allele (G) of \\nrs738409 was noticeably more frequent in Sicilian controls \\nthan in European reference populations.\\nGRP78 and PNPLA3 polymorphisms and HCC\\nBoth rs430397 in GRP78 and rs738409 in PNPLA3 \\nwere significantly associated with HCC risk in this Sicilian \\nancestry cohort (Table 4). The association between \\nrs430397 in GRP78 and HCC risk is best described by a \\ndominant model (AA+AG vs. GG), (p= 0.0095, OR= 1.81) \\nwhereas the association between rs738409 in PNPLA3 is \\nOncotarget\\n86793\\nwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\\nbest described by a recessive model (GG vs. CG +CC), \\n(p= 6.28x10-3, OR= 2.56) (Table 5).\\nWhen the analyses were confined to cases with \\nHCC related to chronic HCV infection there was no \\nevidence of association between rs430397 in GRP78 \\nand HCC risk (Table 5). Because the frequency of the \\nrs430397: AA genotype in this stratified cohort was \\nvery low, an association test under a recessive model of \\ninheritance (AA vs. AG+GG) could not be performed \\nusing logistic regression. In contrast, the magnitude of the \\nassociation between rs738409 in PNPLA3 and HCC risk \\nincreased when confined to the HCV positive HCC cases \\n(p=2.41x10-3, OR=2.82) (Table 5). There was no evidence \\nfor an epistatic interaction between the two variants and \\nHCC risk (Pasymptotic = 0.8, ORinteraction = 1.08).

Further the possibility that these risk-associated \\ngenetic variants could be used to prediction the development \\nof HCC on an individual patient basis was explored, using a \\nmachine learning technique, with promising results.\\nRs430397 lies in the fifth intron of GRP78. It has \\nbeen associated with HCC risk in Chinese with HBV \\ninfection [10, 11] but does not appear to have been studied \\nin European populations previously. As a non-protein-\\ncoding SNP, it could influence gene/protein function by \\naltering gene expression but there is no direct evidence, to \\ndate, that this variant has functional effects. However, it \\ndoes not lie in a GRP78 gene region associated with high \\ntranscriptional activity [25] nor in a CpG island associated \\nwith epigenetic mechanisms of gene silencing (T. Mazza: \\npersonal communication October 2016).\\nPhysiologically the GRP78 protein acts as a \\nmolecular chaperone, which is activated by endoplasmic \\nreticulum stress [26] and is involved in intracellular \\nCharacteristics\\nrs430397\\nrs738409\\nA/A + G/A \\n(n=47)\\nG/G \\n(n=123)\\np\\nC/C (n=71) C/G (n=64)\\nG/G \\n(n=35)\\np  \\n(C/C vs \\nC/G)\\np  \\n(C/C vs \\nG/G)\\nThrombocytopaenia:\\nYes\\n42 (89.4%) 95 (77.2%)\\n55 (77.5%) 52 (81.5%) 30 (85.7%)\\n0.742\\n0.458\\nNo\\n5 (10.6%)\\n28 (22.8%)\\n0.116\\n16 (22.5%) 12 (18.8%)\\n5 (14.3%)\\nProlonged prothrombin \\ntime\\nYes\\n16 (34%)\\n37 (30.1%)\\n23 (32.4%) 20 (31.2%) 10 (28.6%)\\n0.966\\n0.860\\nNo\\n31 (66%)\\n86 (69.9%)\\n0.754\\n48 (67.6%) 44 (68.7%) 25 (71.4%)\\nHyperbilirubinaemia\\nYes\\n5 (10.6%)\\n6 (4.9%)\\n3 (4.2%)\\n5 (7.8%)\\n3 (8.6%)\\n0.606\\n0.643\\nNo\\n42 (89.4%) 117 (95.1%)\\n0.309\\n68 (95.8%) 59 (92.2%) 32 (91.4%)\\nHypoalbuminaemia\\nYes\\n4 (8.4%)\\n9 (7.3%)\\n4 (5.6%)\\n7 (10.9%)\\n2 (5.7%)\\n0.418\\n0.667\\nNo\\n43 (91.5%) 114 (92.7%)\\n0.952\\n67 (94.4%) 57 (89.1%) 33 (94.3%)\\nRaised serum \\nalphafetoprotein\\nYes\\n8 (17%)\\n29 (23.6%)\\n0.472\\n16 (22.5%)\\n16 (25%)\\n5 (14.3%)\\n0.894\\n0.458\\nNo\\n39 (83%)\\n94 (76.4%)\\n55 (77.5%)\\n48 (75%)\\n30 (85.7%)\\nOncotarget\\n86797\\nwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\\nFigure 1: Decision tree based on the genotypes of both PNPLA3 and GRP78 SNPs.

It has also been reported to \\nsustain cell survival, to inhibit apoptosis and to promote \\nthe invasion and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro [28–31]. \\nHowever, the precise role of GRP78 in the development of \\ncancer is still not clear [32, 33].\\nRs738409 lies in the third exon of PNPLA3 and \\nencodes a nonsynonymous alteration in the protein \\nsequence (Ile148Met). This SNP came to prominence \\nwhen identified as a risk factor for the progression of non-\\nalcohol related fatty liver disease [16] and the development \\nof alcohol-related cirrhosis [17]. Subsequently, the risk \\nallele of rs738409 was shown to be associated with the \\ndevelopment of HCC in patients of European descent \\nwith established cirrhosis [20]. Rs738409 has also been \\nassociated with the development of HCC in East Asian \\npopulations [34, 35]. The risk allele of rs738409 has \\nalso been studied in relation to HCV-related liver injury, \\nalthough associations are less consistent [36, 37]. The \\nresults of the present study show that the rs738409:G allele \\nis a significant risk for HCC in the Sicilian population. \\nThe fact that the strength of the association was increased \\nin the subgroup with HCV-related cirrhosis with an \\neffect size that exceeds that in many other studies is of \\ninterest but has to be weighed against the fact that these \\nindividuals comprised almost 85% of the study population.\\nDespite the substantial genetic evidence implicating \\nrs738409 and PNPLA3 with cirrhosis and HCC of different \\naetiologies, the function of the PNPLA3 protein remains \\nuncertain as does the effect of the Ile148Met substitution. \\nThe 148Met risk allele appears to promote intracellular \\ntriglyceride retention [38] but the functional changes that \\nlead to the development of significant liver damage and \\nHCC remain to be established. Of interest the association \\nbetween rs738409 and liver disease progression appears \\nto be independent of the severity of liver fat accumulation \\n[20, 39]. Further, the functional effects of this variant may \\ndirectly or indirectly regulate the release of molecules \\nFigure 3: Decision tree developed fixing the rs430397 A/A and G/A genotypes.

This difference in allele \\nfrequency could reflect genetic isolation of the population \\nof Sicily. However, a recent study has shown that Sicilians \\nare genetically similar to mainland Italians from the \\nadjacent regions [44]. Another potential explanation for \\nthis observation could be cryptic underlying population \\nstratification, which may have arisen due to the use of blood-\\ndonor controls. Despite this, similar blood-donor controls are \\nused in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control consortium cohort \\n[45] with little evidence to suggest significant population \\nstratification in their analyses.\\nThere was no evidence, in the present study, of an \\nepistatic interaction between the GRP78 and PNPLA3 \\nvariants in relation to HCC risk. In addition there were \\nno significant associations between either variant and any \\nclinical features or the results of any of the laboratory \\ninvestigation. However, combinations of these various \\nattributes together with the rs430397 and rs738409 \\ngenotypes were used to produce a model, graphically \\ndisplayed as a decision tree, which could be useful for \\npredicting subjects at risk for developing HCC, at least \\nwithin this study population. The best prediction model \\nused only age, sex and alcohol as the additional required \\nvariables and was represented by a decision tree with a \\nMCR of 17.0%.\\nIn conclusion: rs430397 in GRP78 and rs738409 in \\nPNPLA3 are risk factors for the development of HCC in \\na Southern Italian population of cases with predominantly \\nHCV-related cirrhosis. Use of a machine-learning \\napproach allowed development of a prediction model \\nincorporating phenotypic, clinical and genotypic variables. \\nThis computational approach needs to be further explored \\nand the predictions independently validated. If confirmed, \\nthis approach could be used to identify individuals at risk \\nat an early stage thereby facilitating monitoring and, when \\nrequired, early intervention.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nStudy populations\\nThe 170 HCC cases were enrolled at the Department \\nof Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties of the \\nPoliclinico Hospital, Palermo, Italy. All had been born \\nin Sicily and continued to reside there. The aetiology \\nof the liver disease was determined using historical, \\nclinical, laboratory, imaging and histological information. \\nThe diagnosis of cirrhosis and HCC were made based \\non previously reported criteria [46], and international \\nguidelines [47]. In the majority of instances the diagnosis \\nof cirrhosis was based on historical, clinical, laboratory \\nand radiological variables; histological confirmation was \\navailable in a minority from liver biopsy material obtained \\nvia the percutaneous route (Table 2). The diagnosis of \\nHCC was based on historical, clinical, and laboratory \\nvariables together with, as recommended, multimodal \\nimaging (Table 3). The 304 healthy blood donors, who \\nacted as controls, were recruited at the Azienda di Rilievo \\nNazionale ad Alta Specialiazzione (A.R.N.A.S.) Civico \\nHospital of Palermo, Italy. Controls were only included if \\nthey were born in and continued to reside in Sicily; were \\naged > 30 years and in line with International guidelines \\n[48, 49] were negative for HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti HIV \\nantibodies and had normal routine blood test results.\\nAll included cases and controls provided written \\ninformed consent. This research was approved by the \\nEthics committee of the Policlinico Hospital (Palermo, \\nItaly).\\nDNA extraction and genotyping\\nGenomic DNA was extracted from whole \\nblood using the WizardGenomic DNA Purification \\nKit (Promega). DNA quality was assessed using gel \\nelectrophoresis (0.8% agarose gel; 5 volts/cm for 1 hour; \\n1× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer; 100 bp and 1kb DNA \\nLadder (Promega, UK). Genotyping for rs430397 in \\nGRP78 and rs738409 in PNPLA3 was performed using \\nthe K-Biosciences Competitive Allele Specific PCR (LGC \\nGenomics, Hoddesdon, UK) platform with amplification \\nand detection undertaken using a LightCycler® 480 real-\\ntime PCR system (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Burgess \\nHill, UK). Genotype calling was performed automatically \\nusing proprietary software with minor manual editing of \\ngenotype calls. Approximately 12% of samples, randomly \\nselected a priori, were genotyped in duplicate to ensure \\nconsistent genotype calling. The primers used for KASPar \\ngenotyping are detailed in Supplementary Table 1.\\nStatistical analysis\\nGenetic analysis\\nTests for genetic association, missingness, deviation \\nfrom Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and epistasis were \\nperformed using PLINK (version 1.9) [50]. Genetic \\nassociation analyses were performed using logistic \\nregression utilizing additive, dominant and recessive \\nmodels when comparing HCC cases and controls. Tests \\nfor association between demographic covariates were \\nperformed under an additive model using the Fisher’s \\nexact test to assess significance. Statistical analyses were \\nperformed in R [51].\\nPrediction modelling\\nA two-step analysis comprising of variable \\nselection and decision tree construction was performed \\nOncotarget\\n86800\\nwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\\nusing a machine learning technique to establish a rule \\nfor predicting phenotypes starting from the genotypes of \\nboth the rs430397 and rs738409 variants. In the first step \\nthe variables to be used in the second step were selected \\nutilizing a stepwise search, which performs a greedy \\nforward or backward search through the space of HCC \\ncase characteristics or attributes. The selection is based on \\na decision tree classifier for estimating the accuracy of the \\nchosen variable subset and is stopped when the addition/\\ndeletion of any remaining attribute resulted in a decrease \\nin evaluation. The second step involved the construction \\nof a tree-like graph or model of decisions based on the \\npreviously selected variables. This model exhibits a \\nflowchart-like structure in which each internal node \\nrepresents a ‘test’ on an attribute, each branch represents \\nthe outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a \\nclass label. The paths from root to leaves represent the \\nclassification rules. The evaluation of the classifier is \\nbased on the overall misclassification rate (MCR); the \\nlower the MCR the better the prediction modelling. Both \\nsteps were performed using the RWeka package (R-3.2.3 \\nsoftware).\\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\\nNone of the authors declare a conflicts of interest.\\nGRANT SUPPORT\\nMV is supported by a My First Associazione \\nItaliana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) Grant-AIRC Grant \\nNo.13419, by UCL and by grants No. LQ1605 (MEYS \\nCR) and FNUSA-ICRC No. CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0123 \\n(OP VaVpI).\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

To assess FoG, current clinical practice mostly employs repeated evaluations over\\nweeks and months based on questionnaires, which may not accurately map the severity of\\nthis symptom. The use of a non-invasive system to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL)\\nand the PD symptoms experienced by patients throughout the day could provide a more\\naccurate and objective evaluation of FoG in order to better understand the evolution of the\\ndisease and allow for a more informed decision-making process in making adjustments to\\nthe patient’s treatment plan. This paper presents a new algorithm to detect FoG with a\\nmachine learning approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a single tri-axial\\naccelerometer worn at the waist. The method is evaluated through the acceleration signals\\nin an outpatient setting gathered from 21 PD patients at their home and evaluated under two\\ndifferent conditions: first, a generic model is tested by using a leave-one-out approach and,\\nsecond, a personalised model that also uses part of the dataset from each patient.

Furthermore, the SVM approach adopted has been compared to the most\\ncomprehensive FoG detection method currently in use (referred to as MBFA in this paper).\\nResults of our novel generic method provide an enhancement of 11.2% in the GM compared\\nto the MBFA generic model and, in the case of the personalised model, a 10% of improve-\\nment with respect to the MBFA personalised model.

According to the Global Declaration for Parkinson’s Disease, PD affects up to 6.3 million\\npeople worldwide [1]. Among the many PD symptoms, Freezing of Gait (FoG) is one of the\\nmost incapacitating and is usually present in the more advanced phase of the disease [2,3].\\nFoG is commonly described by PD patients as if their feet were “glued to the floor” resulting in\\nloss of postural balance frequently causing falls [4,5]. In addition to the motor complications\\narising from FoG, it can also lead to non-motor complications including social isolation,\\ndepression, and anxiety. [6,7].\\nThe precise tracking of the occurrence of FoG is challenging for clinicians. The acquisition\\nof such information can greatly help in optimising therapies including pharmacotherapy, and\\nphysiotherapy, that are known to be beneficial for reducing FoG episodes [4]. Furthermore, by\\nacquiring accurate information on FoG frequency and severity in conjunction with the full\\nrepertoire of other motor and non-motor symptomatology, this would provide to the neurolo-\\ngists a more accurate overall view of the disease status and evolution over time. Additionally,\\nthe online detection of FoG opens up the possibility of incorporating actuation methodologies\\nsuch as rhythmic auditory cues that might shorten or prevent FoG episodes [8,9]. These rhyth-\\nmic auditory cues are hereafter referred to as cueing.\\nIn clinical practice, there are two methods employed to evaluate the presence of FoG. The\\nfirst is based on specific gait tests, for example the Timed Up & Go test performed through a\\nnarrow space, using specific circuits with several turns [10–12] or by assessing patients while\\nperforming rapid and short steps [13]. The second method is based on answers given by\\npatients and caregivers about the frequency and severity of FoG episodes collected in specific\\nFoG questionnaires [14–16]. These methods have major drawbacks due to both the clinical set-\\nting not reflecting real life settings as well as the timing of the evaluation not replicating the\\nrecognised variability in FOG frequency. FoG episodes often occur in the patient’s own home\\nand their frequency is reduced significantly in controlled environments such as the laboratory\\nsetting [17]. Self-assessment of FoG, has shown to be unreliable since patients and caregivers\\nmay not perceive the episodes and, furthermore, because PD patients often experience mem-\\nory loss, inattention or dementia, leading to imprecise recall [18].\\nTherefore, many attempts have been made to obtain an objective and precise method for\\nmonitoring FoG in patients during their normal activities of daily living (ADL). In this con-\\ntext, many different types of sensors have been employed. The most widespread method to\\nobjectively detect FoG is based on the analysis of data emanating from wearable motion sen-\\nsors, as they are unobtrusive, portable with low power consumption, providing currently the\\nmost suitable way to evaluate FoG episodes in patients’ own homes.\\nMost methods to detect FoG based on wearable sensors have been developed and tested\\nunder controlled conditions [19–27], which is mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining a valid\\ngold standard outside the laboratory setting. Therefore, trained algorithms are likely to gener-\\nate several false positives when they are tested in real life since algorithms have not been\\ntrained for specific situations that could happen in patients daily living activities. As far as the\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n2 / 26\\nFunding: This project has been performed within\\nthe framework of the \"Freezing in Parkinson’s\\nDisease: Improving Quality of Life with an\\nAutomatic Control System\" (MASPARK) project\\nwhich is funded by La Fundacio´ La Marato´ de TV3\\n20140431 [http://www.tv3.cat/marato/es/\\nprojectes_financats_2013]. This work also forms\\npart of the framework of the FP7 project \"Personal\\nHealth Device for the Remote and Autonomous\\nManagement of Parkinson’s Disease\" (REMPARK)\\nICT-287677, which is funded by the European\\nCommunity [http://www.rempark.eu/].\\nCompeting interests: Albert Samà, Carlos Pe´rez-\\nLo´pez, Andreu Català, Juan Manuel Moreno, Joan\\nCabestany and Alejandro Rodrı´guez-Molinero are\\nshareholders of Sense4Care, which is a spin-off\\ncompany.

This does not\\nalter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on\\nsharing data and materials.\\nauthors are aware, only Ahlrichs et al. have generated an algorithm to detect FoG in PD\\npatients’ own homes [28]; however, part of the evaluation was not performed with PD patients\\nwith FoG and the latency time of the algorithm was every minute, which is too slow to be effec-\\ntive for cueing purposes. Until now, objective FoG assessment during ADLs in the home has\\nnot been extensively examined, thus, it might not be reliable. The usability and acceptability of\\nany new wearable device is critical to its success. Many studies have employed several sensors\\nat specific locations (Table 1) providing promising results in some cases. However, their usage\\nmay be counterproductive when monitoring FoG at home, as they require patients to wear\\nmany sensors, reducing the usability of the monitoring system and its acceptability. Thus, the\\ntrade-off between accuracy and usability is a key factor in designing such systems. The waist is\\none of the most suitable placements for detecting FoG [28–31]. Furthermore, according to\\nMathie et al., locating a wearable system at a side of the waist is the most comfortable place, as\\nconcluded in a questionnaire performed by elderly people [32]. Additionally, in humans the\\nwaist is close to the centre of gravity better representing body movement [33] and also allowing\\nthe sensor to monitor other PD symptoms such as bradykinesia or dyskinesia [34,35].\\nThis paper presents a study performed within the ‘Freezing in Parkinson’s Disease: Improv-\\ning Quality of Life with an Automatic Control System’ (MASPARK) project [36] for detecting\\nFoG by locating a single wearable sensor at the waist. More specifically, this paper presents a\\nnew machine learning based algorithm to detect FoG episodes validated by clinical experts, in\\nPD patients’ own home [37]. Furthermore, and with the aim of evaluating the algorithm in\\nreal life, the proposed algorithm is also designed with the purpose of being implemented in a\\nmicrocontroller, thus, some issues in the computational resources used by the method such as\\nwindowing and the classification cost have also been taken into account. The approach pre-\\nsented here is compared to the most extended algorithm used to detect FoG (hereafter referred\\nto as the Moore-Bächlin FoG Algorithm, MBFA) [21]. The validation methodology employed\\nfor both approaches consists of a Leave-One-Patient-Out. Furthermore, this leave one out\\nanalysis is compared to a user-dependent algorithm, in which an individualised model classi-\\nfier is evaluated. Results on 21 PD patients show that the generic proposed approach outper-\\nforms the current most employed FoG detection method by an average 11%, with a sensitivity\\nof 74.7% (proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as positives) and specificity\\nof 79% (proportion of actual negatives correctly identified as negatives) compared to a sensitiv-\\nity of 81.6% and specificity of 52.6%. In addition, personalisation of the detection model\\nachieves an improvement in the symptom detection of around 10% on average (80.1 on sensi-\\ntivity, 88.1% on specificity against an 89.1% on sensitivity and 61.5% on specificity). Thus, a\\nmachine learning approach can be used to monitor FoG during the daily life of PD patients\\nand, furthermore, personalised models for FoG detection can be used to improve the monitor-\\ning accuracy.\\nThe paper is organised as follows: first a background with the most relevant FoG detection\\nsystems and algorithms is introduced, then the proposed methodologies, the experiments per-\\nformed and the evaluation of the algorithms are presented, and finally, the results, discussion\\nand conclusions are provided.\\nRelated work\\nFoG has been analysed with a wide variety of systems and sensors. Some of these reports have\\nemployed systems to capture FoG episodes that are not transferable to normal daily life of\\npatients since they can only be used in a laboratory setting. Some examples are pressure plat-\\nforms [38–41], which are non-portable systems, electroencephalogram (EEG) [42], electromy-\\nography (EMG) [25] or skin conductance [43], which involves the placement of electrodes on\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n3 / 26\\nTable 1.

Other obtrusive system exam-\\nples are knee-joint goniometers [23] or cameras and video systems, which also have a low\\nacceptability by users in a non-laboratory setting [23,39,44]. Thus, given that PD monitoring\\nshould be ambulatory and should last several hours in order to provide useful clinical informa-\\ntion [34,45], most works have employed non-invasive systems such as wearable systems based\\nin microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).\\nIn 2003, Han et al. used MEMS based inertial systems, i.e. accelerometers, to explore fea-\\ntures to analyse FoG episodes. They found that the frequency response in 2 patients wearing\\naccelerometers at the ankle was around 6–8 Hz [19]. In 2008, Moore et al. proposed a method-\\nology for detecting FoG with an accelerometer at the ankle where they described the Freezing\\nIndex (FI), which is the quotient of the power spectral density (PSD) from 3 to 8 Hz (Freezing\\nBand, FB) and the PSD from 0.5 to 3 Hz (Walking Band, WB) [21]. When the FI exceeds an\\nidentified threshold (Freezing Threshold, FTH), a FoG episode is considered to have occurred.\\nDue to the presence of false positives (FP) when the patient is at rest, Ba¨chlin et al., in 2009,\\nintroduced the Power Index (PI), defined as the addition of WB and FB, which was compared\\nto the Power Threshold (PTH) to establish if there was any relevant quantity of movement\\nwhen FI was high [21]. PI indicates the amount of movement, therefore, situations where\\npatients were not moving voluntarily were eliminated. In this final algorithm, a FoG episode is\\nthen determined to occur if FI>FTH and PI>PTH. The MBFA algorithm is the most\\nadvanced FoG detection algorithm due to its low computational cost and good performance\\n[22–24,26,27,31,46–50].\\nThe MBFA algorithm has been widely employed to analyse FoG, although usually in labora-\\ntory conditions and very often with low patient numbers. Jovanov et al. implemented this algo-\\nrithm in real time, although only one patient was used to test the algorithm. Furthermore, no\\nresults on sensitivity and specificity were reported [22]. Zabaleta et al. analysed FoG by means\\nof a triaxial accelerometer and a biaxial gyroscope in different locations of the lower limbs.\\nThe main features employed were the FI in conjunction with power spectral densities changes.\\nThey were capable of correctly detecting 82.7% of FoG episodes with inertial sensors located at\\neach ankle, though only in 2 PD patients [24]. Other attempts to analyse FoG include Stamata-\\nkis et al. [51] and Takac et al.[44], but they only used one patient to test the system for PD gait\\nextraction and a system for contextualising FoG events, respectively.\\nIn recent years, Niazmand et al. (2011) presented the Mimed-pants [26], a washable jogging\\npants with five integrated accelerometers. They employed MBFA for detecting FoG achieving\\nan 88.3% on sensitivity and 85.3% on specificity in 6 PD patients in a short and controlled test\\nfocused on inducing FoG regardless of a false positives test. In a recent work in 2012, Zhao\\net al. [46] performed an embedded algorithm based in the MBFA approach within the Mimed-\\npants system obtaining 81% for sensitivity with 8 PD patients using similar tests. More\\nrecently, Mazilu et al. proposed new online algorithms using 3 accelerometers and comparing\\ndifferent machine learning classifiers that exploit MBFA features, as well as few other ones, in\\nTable 1.

Results obtained showed higher than 95% for specificity and sensitivity\\nwith different classifiers. However, tests were performed under controlled conditions and, fur-\\nthermore, the validation methodology overestimated the performance measures since classifi-\\ners were trained, iteratively, with all window signals available from a patient except for one\\nwindow, which was used to obtain the performance values. Therefore, training and testing pat-\\nterns were very similar, which is very different from normal ADLs. Thus, the reported specific-\\nities and sensitivities would be expected to dramatically decrease free-living conditions. In\\n2013, Moore et al. published their most recent work focused on the MBFA. In this work, they\\ncompared different configurations applying the same algorithm on 25 PD patients, among\\nwhom 20 had FoG episodes. Different window sizes, sensor locations, and different values for\\nFTH and PTH were evaluated in order to find the optimal conditions. Results showed better\\nperformances with longer windows; however, with a long window size, Moore et al. reported a\\nrelevant loss of sensitivity at short episodes that, paradoxically, are the most frequent in PD\\npatients [27]. In a more complex test than the one performed previously [20] using up to 7 sen-\\nsors and a longer test protocol, they achieved sensitivity and specificity over 70% but, in some\\nconfigurations (window size: 7.5s) with the system worn on the back of the waist, both sensitiv-\\nities and specificities were over 80%. In a different approach, Tripoliti et al. proved different\\nfeatures and locations in order to also know the best configuration [52]. The work was per-\\nformed with 5 PD patients and under controlled conditions, with a specific protocol designed\\nto elicit FoG and without FP protocol tests. In this work, they also used 2 gyroscopes along\\nwith 6 accelerometers located in different body parts. With all the sensors worn, they obtained\\nan accuracy of 96.11%, 98.74% of specificity and 81.94% of sensitivity with a leave-one-\\npatient-out method. On the other hand, with a single IMU on the waist they report a 75% of\\nsensitivity and 95% of specificity, although the algorithm is not compared with any other\\nmethod under the same conditions.\\nIn a more recent study from Mazilu’s group, they investigated unsupervised feature learn-\\ning for building an optimal input vector for a decision tree classifier with the DAPHNET proj-\\nect dataset (10 PD patients). Their approach was compared to an analogous MBFA method in\\nwhich the FI and the energy of the spectral band between 0.5Hz and 8Hz were evaluated. The\\ntraining and testing was user-dependent and under controlled conditions. Results enhanced\\nthe similar MBFA method by up to 8.1% in terms of F1-score. Another approach was pre-\\nsented by Rodrı´guez et al. who proposed a method to contextualise FoG episodes by means of\\nan activity recognition algorithm, which rejected those false positives when the patient was sit-\\nting and performed activities such as drawing or typing on a laptop. The specificity was\\nimproved by up to 5% on average reaching an enhancement of 11.9% in some cases [50]. How-\\never, this added-contextualisation method did not contribute to enhanced sensitivity. Other\\nworks have studied the variability of gait between a FoG episode and normal gait. Although\\nthe results are interesting, they failed to include false positive results and a reliable classification\\nwas not performed [53,54]. A recent paper by Zach et al. presented a new methodology to elicit\\nFoG under laboratory conditions which was evaluated with the MBFA algorithm obtaining\\n75% on sensitivity and 76% on specificity [31].\\nFinally, Ahlrichs et al., within the REMPARK project [55], used Support Vector Machines\\n(SVM) for detecting FoG episodes in 8 patients with PD at their own homes. The method\\nincluded tests in different motor states and used a single accelerometer at the waist, achieving\\naccuracies of over 90%. However, specificity was only computed with non-FoG patients,\\nwhich could lead to unreliable predictions since the models were not tested with PD patients\\nwith FoG who move slightly differently to those patients without FoG [30]. Furthermore, the\\nevaluation was performed over a single minute, which is considered too long if cueing is desir-\\nable [28].\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n6 / 26\\nTables 1 and 2 summarise the methods presented in the work we have highlighted.\\nMethods\\nThis section describes the new approach proposed by the authors to detect FoG with a super-\\nvised machine learning technique and the experimental methods used to evaluate it. The\\nsection is divided into 4 sub-sections, (Fig 1) that describes the steps performed in the method-\\nology. At the end of the section, there is a final paragraph devoted to the tests performed to\\nevaluate the MBFA algorithm. The first sub-section describes the database collection proce-\\ndure, the protocol tests and baseline data from patients. The second sub-section reports the\\nsignal processing methods for the SVM model and the extraction of features of the signals\\nbased on the online implementation requirements. The third section details the procedure to\\nderive an SVM-based classifier based on a generic model for all patients and in a personalised\\nmodel. Finally, the evaluation for FoG episodes is described in the fourth section, with respect\\nto the personalised and the generic approaches. In addition, a fifth sub-section has been\\nincluded, in which the assessment of the MBFA is also explained with the aim to compare the\\nproposed approach to this widely extended algorithm. Although the evaluation of the classifier\\nis the same as the proposed model, the training and feature extraction processes are different;\\nthis is detailed in this final section.\\nData collection\\nThe study was approved by local Ethics Commission: Spanish Agency for Drugs and Medical\\nDevices (Spain), Clinical Research Ethics Committee-Galway University Hospitals, Health\\nDepartment Maccabi Healthcare Services and Ethics Committee Fondazione Santa Lucia. PD\\npatients were diagnosed according the UK Brain Bank [60] criteria and all of them gave their\\nwritten informed consent to perform the datasets.\\nA total of 21 patients (3 women and 18 men) with PD participated in the experimental pro-\\ntocol to collect signals. The experimental protocol was part of the REMPARK project [55],\\nwhich grouped a total of 92 patients with PD (36 women, 56 men) from 4 health centres in\\nEurope, Centro Me´dico Teknon (Spain), Maccabi Healthcare Services (Israel), Fondazione\\nSanta Lucia (Italy) and National University of Galway (Ireland) [61].\\nIn REMPARK’s experimental protocol, all patients performed the tests both in “OFF” and\\n“ON” states. “OFF” states are those periods where rigidity, bradykinesia or postural alterations\\nappear in PD patients. During the “ON” state, these symptoms are mitigated due to medication\\neffect although other side effects may appear, such as dyskinesias. The inclusion criteria in this\\nclinical protocol were Hoehn & Yahr stage [62] greater than 2 in the OFF state and the absence\\nof dementia according to DSM IV criteria [60]. In this work, which is focused on the detection\\nof FoG episodes, some additional inclusion criteria have been required. First, PD patients\\nshould have a FoG Questionnaire (FoG-Q) [15] score above 6, and only those PD patients\\nwhose total FoG duration was at least one minute long were selected. Overall, 21 patients out\\nof the 92 patients matched all inclusion criteria for this study (Table 3). The mean age was\\n69.29±9.72 years old and the mean Hoehn & Yahr stage scoring was 3.07±0.43 in the OFF\\nstate. Sixteen patients needed walking assistance and the mean FoG-Q test index was 15.8\\n±4.11, the lowest score being 7 and the highest score 23. Six out of 21 patients did not exhibit\\ndyskinesias, and eleven patients had wearing-off phenomena. At time of the tests, all patients\\nwere medicated with optimal doses of levodopa and dopamine agonist therapy. Some baseline\\ndata from patient 5 were lost, which is shown as N/A in Table 3; however, they do not affect to\\nthe results of this study.\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n7 / 26\\nTable 2.

Although the proto-\\ncol test consisted of specific scripted activities, the test also allowed patients to perform several\\nactivities in a free moving manner. Furthermore, the activities were performed in a familiar\\nenvironment and the patient could proceed with their normal ADLs in a natural way. More\\nspecifically, the activities performed in both tests consisted of I) showing the researchers\\naround their home; II) Stand Up and Go test crossing through a doorway and then, turning\\nback (FoG provocation test), which was repeated up to 10 times; III) going outdoors and tak-\\ning a short walk; and IV) a dual task activity (e.g. reading while carrying an object). In the sec-\\nond test, i.e. following medication, a false positive protocol activity for FoG was additionally\\nperformed. This protocol test relies on performing different activities in which the patient exe-\\ncutes a short and fast movement repeatedly whose inertial frequency content is similar to a\\nFoG episode. The executed activities were brushing their teeth, painting/drawing/erasing on a\\nsheet of paper and cleaning windows.\\nA total of 93.03 minutes of FoG episodes were registered (1321 episodes) among these 21\\npatients, among which 74.12 minutes (79.67%) were registered when patients were in OFF\\nstate, 12.35 minutes (13.28%) were registered when patients were in ON state and 6.56 minutes\\n(7.05%) were registered in an intermediate state.\\nAcceleration signals were captured while patients executed the described protocol with the\\n9x2 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a small (77x37x21mm3) and light (78g with battery)\\nwearable inertial system (Fig 2) which was located at the left side of the waist [64]. This IMU,\\nwhose autonomy lasts more than a day, stored the accelerometer data at 200Hz in a microSD\\ncard.\\nAll tests were video-recorded and videos were synchronised with the signals recorded by\\nthe 9x2 device through a specific method [37]. In order to create a gold standard for the occur-\\nrence of FoG episodes, videos were labelled offline by an experienced clinician. Within the\\nMASPARK project [36], all activities, postures and partial FoG episodes were labelled by\\nclinicians.\\nPre-processing and feature extraction\\nThis subsection presents a description of the employed method for pre-processing the signal,\\nwhich comprises signal conditioning, windowing and feature extraction. Note that, since the\\nproposed algorithm is thought to be implemented in the near future within the 9x2 device for\\nits real-time execution, some computational issues have been taken into account to facilitate\\nthis future implementation. For example, windows with reduced amount of samples are con-\\nsidered in order to, first, reduce the latency time of the algorithm; second, to deal with the\\nFig 2.

This data\\nis resampled at 40Hz since this frequency has been shown to be enough to analyse human\\nmovements [65] and it is sufficient to analyse the frequencies obtained during FoG episodes\\n[20]. Once resampled, inertial signals are filtered in order to remove the high frequency noise\\nthrough a 2nd order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 15Hz cut-off frequency.\\nThe next step is to window the signal. According to Moore and colleagues, the specificity in\\nvery small window sizes is very low, thus, it is recommended to work with windows over 2.5 s\\n[27]. In other previous work, Ba¨chlin et al. worked in window sizes of 4s [29], Mazilu et al.\\nshowed how FoG detection performance was kept with windows over 3s [48] and Zach et al.\\nshowed that window lengths between 2 and 4 s. provided similar results [31]. In order to\\nachieve a similar window length and given that the sampling frequency is 40Hz, a window\\nlength of 128 samples (N = 128), i.e. 3.2s of window-length, is proposed. Windows are over-\\nlapped at 50% so as to prevent information loss between windows.\\nWith the aim to obtain significant information from each window, some features are\\nextracted. These features will be the input vector, xi, for the proposed classifier in Training pro-\\ncesses section, which is based on machine learning techniques. In this work, a total of 55 fea-\\ntures are employed, which are presented in Fig 3. Features are briefly described below by\\ngrouping them according to their purpose. The number of feature group is noted within\\nbrackets.\\nFig 3.

Let jSW\\nh j ¼ jXW\\nh j þ jYW\\nh j þ jZW\\nh j be the summation of harmonics for each accelerometer\\naxis, where h = 0.1, . . .,8 Hz, so that a vector SW ¼ ½SW\\n1 ; . . . ; SW\\nN � is obtained, which represents\\nthe spectral information in the [0.1, 8] Hz band in a certain window. PCA has been used to\\nreduce the dimensionality of these harmonics. More specifically, PCA has been applied to a set\\nof SW vectors organised in a matrix M ¼ ½S1T S2T; . . . ; SLT�\\nT. These L windows are a randomly\\nselected subset of the training data composed by a 10% of the data from each patient, thus con-\\ntaining both FoG episodes and other signals. PCA is applied to in order to obtain the ortho-\\nnormal change of basis matrix V that brings each pattern SW from the original space to the\\nlatent one. PCA is applied to matrix M by first centring the data, and then applying a Singular\\nValue Decomposition (SVD) so that M = USV is obtained. In the SVD process, it was identi-\\nfied that only the first three latent variables contributed with data (i.e. their singular values\\nwere significantly higher than the rest). In consequence, only the first three components of the\\nlatent representation of SW, i.e. V SW, are employed as features (feature group 10). Note that\\nthe PCA process is only applied once in the training process and a real-time implementation\\nof the feature-extraction process would only require the implementation of the product V SW.\\nTraining processes\\nThe symptoms related to FoG episodes are user dependent with typical symptoms manifesting\\nas gait abnormalities (e.g. shuffling, leg trembling in place and akinetic episodes) [11]. As each\\nFoG patient experiences these symptoms in different ways, developing an algorithm to detect\\nFoG episodes from inertial signals can be challenging due to the variation between individual\\nsignals. To overcome these challenges previous researchers have developed user dependent\\nalgorithms capable of detecting FoG episodes with a high degree of accuracy [21,48]. These\\nalgorithms require the prior capturing of the patients inertial signals in order to train the algo-\\nrithm, thus making the algorithm cumbersome to obtain. A less challenging solution would be\\nto develop a generalised algorithm, since it would only require the obtaining of inertial signals\\nfrom a relatively small cohort of FoG patients in order to train the algorithm for use with any\\npatient. To investigate both types of algorithms and their associated training processes we pro-\\nposed two methodologies I) a generic model through a leave one out method and II) a model\\nthat is personalised to each patient.\\nGeneric FoG model selection.\\nIn order to obtain a generic (user independent) model, a\\nleave-one-patient-out methodology has been adopted. The model is generic in the sense that it\\nis not personalised to any patient and there is no adjustment made to the model that considers\\nthe patient for which the model is tested on. Given the nature of the problem at hand, Support\\nVector Machines (SVM) have been considered to be the most suitable classifier, due to their\\nhigh performance method for two-class classification and ease of implementation within\\nmicrocontrollers [70]. SVM is a machine learning technique that use the kernel trick to map\\ninput vectors (xi 2 <N; 1 � i � p) to a higher dimensional feature space by φ(xi), where typi-\\ncally φ : <n ! <m and subjected by m > n. The kernel trick enables SVM to avoid bringing xi\\nto the higher dimensional space by computing the dot product of patterns within <n.\\nIn our approach, each xi is represented by 55 parameters (previously described in the Pre-\\nprocessing and feature extraction section) which characterise the current window W. The input\\nvectors are associated to one of two different classes, FoG or no-FoG. These classes are repre-\\nsented by the labels yi = {1, −1}, 1 � i � p, where yi = 1 in case of a FoG pattern and yi = -1 in\\ncase of a non-FoG pattern. The set of yi values is provided by clinical experts with the help of\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n13 / 26\\nvideo recordings that were synchronised with their associated inertial signals. In order to max-\\nimise the margin, reduce the empirical error and minimise the structural risk, a hyperplane is\\nbuilt to separate the 2 classes [71]. The optimal hyperplane is defined according to the follow-\\ning optimisation problem:\\nminimize WðaÞ ¼\\nXp\\ni¼1ai � 1\\n2\\nXp\\ni;j¼1 aiajyiyj � Kðxi; xjÞ\\n�\\n�\\nð2Þ\\ns: t\\n0 � ai � C;\\ni ¼ 1; . . . ; p\\nin which C is the trade-off between the classification margin and misclassification error, and\\nthe kernel function K(xi, xj) replaces the dot product φ(xi)�φ(xj). The kernel used for the FoG\\nclassifier is a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF), due to its good performance and generalisa-\\ntion capacity, Kðxi; xjÞ ¼ e�gkxi�xjk2, where γ is the width of RBF function.\\nDue to the leave-one-patient-out approach, these parameters must be adjusted with the\\ndata from all patients except one. Thus, with this data, a range of values {10−2, 10−1, . . ., 102}\\nfor C and γ are tested through a 10-fold cross-validation method. From the results of the differ-\\nent folds the average sensitivity and specificity is obtained for each combination of values.\\nOptimal parameters for the SVM (Copt, γopt) are those that maximise the following expression:\\nðCopt; goptÞ ¼ argmaxð\\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nSensitivityC;g � SpecificityC;g\\nq\\nÞ\\nð3Þ\\ns: t: SensitivityC;g > 70%; SpecificityC;g > 70%\\nOnce found, the optimal values are used to train the SVM model. The data from the patient\\nthat is still unused is then employed to test the model with a specific procedure, which is\\ndescribed in the Evaluation of the proposed algorithm section. The entire training process is\\nrepeated by keeping apart the data from each patient; in consequence, the number of SVM\\nmodels obtained is the same as the number of available patients.\\nPersonalised FoG model selection.\\nIn this section, the proposed user-dependent method\\nis described. In order to obtain a user-dependent model, a modified leave-one-patient-out\\nmethod has been adopted, which also has been performed by means of SVM. In contrast to the\\ngeneric model presented in the previous subsection, the personalised model requires labelled\\ninertial signal data from the user in order to obtain the personalised classifier before using it in\\nreal life. Therefore, we will use a portion of the data from the patient being tested to train our\\nclassifier, and the remaining portion of data will be used to evaluate the algorithm. Signals\\nfrom the patient being tested are divided into two sets, the first set being composed of 50% of\\nthe labelled FoG episodes with the corresponding non-episodic signals, and the second set\\ncomprising the remaining FoG episodes and non-episodic windows. Only the first set, i.e. the\\nfirst half, is included in the training dataset, as shown in Fig 4. We note that the optimal choice\\nof the training data would be to include 50% of the signals into the training dataset (without\\nsplitting by episodes) and the remaining 50% into the evaluation dataset. However, there are\\npatients who mostly freeze during the initial data collection while other patients only presented\\nFoG during the second part of the data collection. Therefore, the number of episodes in each\\ndataset would be, in most cases, unbalanced. Hence, the training dataset is chosen to be those\\nparts of the signal from the testing patient that comprise 50% of the FoG episodes, together\\nwith the non-episodic signals, as shown in Fig 4. Due to these requirements and the evaluation\\nprocess, episodes cannot be selected randomly. If FoG episodes were selected randomly, those\\nparts of the signal that do not contain FoG episodes would have to be randomly selected as\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n14 / 26\\nwell. Consequently, the proposed evaluation method would not be valid, since, as shown in the\\nnext Section, True Positives (TP) and False Negatives (FN) depend on episode durations, and\\nTrue Negatives (TN) and False Positives (FP) depend on the amount of detected time spent\\nwithout a positive detection. Thus, random episode selection would make detection’s temporal\\nline disappear and evaluation by episode would be unfeasible.\\nLikewise, the same analysis is performed again but swapping the training and evaluation\\ndatasets of the testing patient employed to train and to validate the model. In consequence,\\nafter first training the model with data from non-testing patients and the first set of the data\\nfrom the testing patient, a second training takes place. In this case, the second set comprising\\nof the last 50% of the episodes, including non-episodic signals, of the testing patient are\\nincluded into the training dataset as shown in the lower part of Fig 4. The first 50% of the epi-\\nsodes and its corresponding non-episodic signals are then employed for evaluating the\\nobtained model. Although other percentages of training/evaluation could be tested, in this\\ncase, the authors consider that the 50% of FoG episodes’ data contains enough information of\\nnon-episodic signals as well.\\nIn this modified leave-one-out approach, data from the non-testing 20 patients represent a\\nclearly greater dataset compared to data from the patient being tested; thus, data from the latter\\nare almost negligible and they would not have any impact in the training process. Hence, it is\\nconsidered interesting to force the model selection process to learn from the testing patient’s\\ndata with more influence than the remaining patients. More specifically, the weight of the test-\\ning patient’s data is set to be the same as the data from the other 20 patients. Thus, data belong-\\ning to the testing patient, represented by tX = {xi} is weighted in the following form. Let n20 be\\nthe number of patterns of the data belonging to 20 patients used to train the model. On the\\nother hand, let the data from the testing patient be divided into two parts with the first and the\\nsecond 50% of FoG episodes as previously described, each part containing nf and ns patterns\\nrespectively. The weight given to the those patterns from the training dataset corresponding to\\nthe testing patient, when the first half is used, is wt ¼\\nn20\\nn20þnf. On the other hand, the weight\\ngiven to those patterns from the training dataset belonging to the 20-patients’ data is\\nw20 ¼\\nnf\\nn20þnf. Accordingly, for the second half, ns would be used instead of nf. Thus, the weight\\ngiven to each part corresponds to the prior of the alternative part of the training dataset. These\\nFig 4.

Afterwards, the methodology for obtaining the\\nSVM model will be repeated switching the parts used in the training and evaluation. Thus, the\\nmodel is prevented from overfitting as only one part of the data is performed by the patient,\\nwhich may coincide with a specific test and not with ADL. Finally, to ensure each patient’s\\ndata is used once as a testing patient the process is completed 21 times.\\nEvaluation of the proposed algorithm\\nTo analysis, the performance of each methodology, a rigorous evaluation is performed which\\nfollows the methodology previously described [72]. Due to likely situations in which patients\\nare sitting, standing, or lying for long periods of time the proportion of TN (conditions in\\nwhich a FoG episode was not detected by the algorithm and the patient was not in a FoG epi-\\nsode) becomes extremely large. Similarly, due to situations in which patients experience long\\nFoG episodes the proportion of TP (conditions in which a FoG episode was detected by the\\nalgorithm and the patient was in a FoG episode) also becomes extremely large. The purposed\\nevaluation process aims to balance the excessive number of TN and TP that may appear with\\nwindow-based evaluations of machine learning approaches through the evaluation analysis of\\nepisodes instead of the evaluation analysis of windows that contain an episode. Therefore, a\\nFoG episode is evaluated from its beginning until its end as a single episode, instead of being\\nevaluated within every window that contains the FoG episode.\\nGiven that during the data collection protocol the minimum time taken by patients to per-\\nform the false positive test was 38s, it was considered that the maximum time of a single TN\\nepisode should be 30 seconds. Thus, for example, if a patient is executing some activity without\\nany FoG episode during 40 seconds, 2 TN are considered. Additionally, a TN episode is only a\\nconsideration if the TN episode is longer than 5 seconds as the average duration of a FoG epi-\\nsode in the collected data was 5.14 seconds (Fig 5). Furthermore, TP, FN, and FP are evaluated\\nfrom Fig 5 as:\\n• A single TP is considered if a FoG episode was detected by the algorithm and the patient was\\nclinically labelled as having a FoG episode.\\n• A single FP is considered if a FoG episode was detected by the algorithm and the patient was\\nclinically labelled as not having a FoG episode.\\n• A single FN is considered if a FoG episode was not detected by the algorithm and the patient\\nwas clinically labelled as having a FoG episode.\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n16 / 26\\nMBFA method assessment\\nTo further analyse the performance of each methodology, a comparison to the most widely\\nused technique of FoG detection is made. Given that the MBFA has been shown to provide\\ngood performance (>80% in sensitivity and specificity in a non-user dependent algorithm\\n[27]) and, in addition, the MBFA has been widely used by many authors for detecting FoG\\n[22–24,26,27,31,46–50], the authors consider the MBFA as an accurate baseline method for\\ncomparison purposes. Similarly, to our proposed approach, a user-independent (leave-one-\\npatient-out) evaluation has been designed for the MBFA method and compared with the pro-\\nposed user-independent method described in the Generic FoG Model Selection section.\\nThe main parameters to be adjusted within the MBFA method are PTH and FTH. Thus, a\\nrange of values for each parameter has been tested for each patient, consisting in values\\n[0,0.5, . . .,4]. After evaluation each pair of PTH and FTH values provide a certain number of\\nTP, TN, FN and FP that are represented in terms of sensitivity\\nSensitivity ¼\\nTP\\nTPþFN\\n�\\n�\\nand speci-\\nficity\\nSpecificity ¼\\nTN\\nTNþFP\\n�\\n�\\n. These values are used to evaluate the MBFA algorithm as described\\nin the Evaluation of the proposed algorithm section. Thus, let EvalkðPTH; FTHÞ : <2 ! <4 be a\\nfunction which returns the number of TP, FP, TN, FN of a given signal from patient k. From\\nthese values, the sensitivity and specificity of the parameters in detecting FoG episodes are\\nobtained based on the previous formulas, which is represented by Sens (Evalk (PTH, FTH))\\nand Spec (Evalk (PTH, FTH)).

The resulting increase of 8.4% obtained for the MBFA is consistent with\\nthe results reported in [21]. Similarly, the SVM method shows better results by considering the\\ndata from the patient being tested, which is an interesting finding that has not been previously\\nreported and that can help to obtain enhanced models for FoG detection.\\nRegarding the performance of the MBFA and the SVM method, it can be seen that the\\nSVM methods geometric mean is significantly greater than the MBFA methods geometric\\nmean. Specifically, the proposed method outperforms the MBFA method with an increase of\\n11.2% for the generic model and an increase of 10% for the personalised model. Thus, the\\ndetection of FoG episodes are significantly improved using the SVM method in comparison to\\nthe MBFA method. In fact, the machine learning approach better generalises the problem in\\nall the results obtained. This is due to the inclusion of several features that characterise in a\\nmore accurate way not only the FoG episodes but also those parts with possible FP, thus pro-\\nviding a much higher specificity. In this sense, it is notable that the specificity of the MBFA\\ngeneric model is 52.6%, while the corresponding SVM-based specificity is 79%.\\nTable 5 presents the individual patient results obtained by the SVM method for both the\\ngeneric and the personalised models. These results aim to show how the personalisation model\\nimproves the detection of FoG episodes in comparison to the generic model. For example, the\\ngeometric mean for patient 1 is only 37.35% for the generic model and 86.2% for the personali-\\nsation model. In total, for 16 patients the personalisation provides an increase in the geometric\\nmean which corresponds to a greater detection of FoG episodes. However, in the remaining 5\\npatients (number 4, 10, 11, 12 and 18), the geometric mean is slightly lower, below 3%. This\\nmay occur when the scenario in the first half of the test is different to the second part and,\\nthus, episodes may appear differently. Most patients freeze similarly during the whole test but,\\nhowever, there are patients who freeze in a different manner inside their homes than outside.\\nTrained models can learn that, in the main, episodes occur in a stereotypical way. When the\\nevaluation is performed outdoors or in a different scenario in the other half of the test the clas-\\nsifier might not work properly and thus the mean could decrease a little compared to the\\ngeneric SVM.\\nSome previous papers have reported results of sensitivity and specificity over 90%, which\\nare higher than those shown in this paper. However, some issues are evident in those works\\n[28,48,52].\\nThe evaluation method consists of a leave one window out, which actually trains the model\\nwith all the windows (including the testing patient) except for one. Therefore, the testing sig-\\nnals are very similar to the trained signals, resulting in very high accuracies. In addition, the\\nleaving one window out approach considers each window either as a positive or a negative\\ncase, which overestimates specificity and sensitivity values, as presented in the previous sec-\\ntions. In the majority of the papers, results have been obtained by considering either laboratory\\nconditions or the use of multiple sensors, which increases the accuracy of FoG detection.\\nIn this work, a more reliable evaluation method has been employed, which consists in eval-\\nuating through the leave one patient out method. Using this method, at least half of the signals\\nfrom the testing patient (for the personalised model) has been omitted in order to properly test\\nthe model. Additionally, our results have been obtained in the patients’ own home and by\\nusing a single sensor located on the waist. The waist location has been shown to be comfortable\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n19 / 26\\nfor users [32] but, in contrast, the detection of FoG accuracy is not as accurate as that obtained\\nby setting the inertial systems on the feet [21]. In consequence, the additional difficulty pro-\\nvided through these conditions also explain the lower results obtained.\\nWith a specificity of 61% and sensitivity values of approximately 50% on average, it is evi-\\ndent that the evaluation of MBFA is reduced due to the new evaluation methodology. In\\naddition, the effect of performing the dataset in patient’s home environments and while per-\\nforming some false positive tests, suggests the MBFA may not be very reliable in a home\\nenvironment.\\nThe proposed evaluation method assesses the algorithm for FoG detection in relation to the\\nnumber of episodes, by balancing the number of TN, TP, FN and FP. However, this method is\\nnot able to determine the length of each episode. Given that the processing method is per-\\nformed through windows, the resolution of the episode can only be 1.6 seconds and the mini-\\nmum FoG episode time is 3.2 seconds according to the specifications reported in the Pre-\\nProcessing and feature extraction section.\\nSo far, the MBFA model has been seen as an optimal model due to its low computational\\ncost and good performance. Compared to our model, the computational burden is signifi-\\ncantly lower; nonetheless, the accuracies obtained are also lower.

Regarding the online optimisation,\\nthe non-user dependent model presented employs an average of 6790±387 support vectors\\namong the different leave-one-out models. Considering 4 bytes for each floating point num-\\nber, an average of 1494KB of memory is required in order to store the SVM model. On the\\nother hand, the user dependent model uses 9221±520 support vectors requiring 2028KB.\\nThese models may require a considerable portion of the memory available on some low to\\nmoderate power consumption and high-performance microcontroller such as Cortex-M4\\nARM microcontrollers. Thus, a reduction of support vectors may be done, for instance, by\\nmeans of Separable Case Approximation method [73]. Using this method, the non-user\\ndependent model is reduced from 7147 support vectors to 4598, reducing the amount of mem-\\nory needed by 30%. Although the proposed algorithm has been developed to be implemented\\nonline within a microcontroller, and there are low power high-performance microcontrollers\\nthat could support the required 1011KB (corresponding memory for 4598 support vectors), a\\nreduction of features should be done, together with further removal of support vectors, in\\norder to minimise the computational burden on the prediction phase. However, this may\\nreduce performance of the algorithm, thus, the trade-off between performance and computa-\\ntional burden, which directly affects the microcontroller capacity and increases its consump-\\ntion has to be considered.\\nConclusions\\nThe MBFA is a method to detect FoG episodes with the analysis of frequency features obtained\\nby an accelerometer signal of a wearable system. This method has been used in numerous\\nstudies [22–24,26,27,31,46–50] due to its simplicity (just the optimisation of 2 features) and its\\nhigh accuracy in detecting FoG episodes (>80%, according to Moore et al. [27]). However, the\\nmethod has only been tested under laboratory conditions without taking into account situa-\\ntions which could lead to false positives. As far as the authors know, the evaluation method\\ndoes not consider those situations where long periods of negative outputs such as sitting, lying,\\nor standing, overstate the specificity results.\\nThis paper presents a supervised machine learning approach to detect FoG that has been\\ntrained and evaluated with an inertial dataset obtained from an IMU located at patients’ waist\\nwhile the PD patients were at home [37]. Two methodologies have been proposed and evalu-\\nated based on the leave one out method. On the one hand, a generic model that is not adjusted\\nto any patient has been proposed, and, on the other hand, a personalised model, which is\\ntrained with part of the inertial signal from the patient undergoing testing. Both generic and\\npersonalised model selection approaches have been assessed with the MBFA and the proposed\\nmachine learning method. Furthermore, an optimisation method to select the MBFA model\\nhas been employed. The evaluation has been performed by balancing the number of true posi-\\ntives and true negatives and also evaluating episode instead of the window, leading to a more\\nreliable assessment. For the personalised model, only the 50% of the FoG episodes including\\nthose non-episodic signals have been used for training, enabling the rest of the signals to be\\nused for evaluation. This percentage has been selected given that some patients have a low\\nnumber of FoG episodes, this way, the evaluation set is larger. Furthermore, validation of\\nresults is more significant if evaluation percentage is larger since the classifier avoids overfit-\\nting, reinforcing, thus, the performance of the model.\\nOur results show how the personalised models outperform the generic models by on aver-\\nage by 10%. However, and as stated in the Personalised FoG model selection section, it requires\\nSVM-based algorithm to detect freezing of gait at home\\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171764\\nFebruary 15, 2017\\n21 / 26\\na data capture and data training process, which is not necessary with the non-user dependent\\nmodel. This process involves taking data from patients with video recording to capture differ-\\nent FoG episodes at the patients’ home with a specific protocol test to elicit FoG episodes. This\\nmethod of data collection can be cumbersome to obtain for the patient.\\nOn the other hand, the machine learning approach enhances significantly the results\\nobtained with the MBFA model. Evaluations per episode show that the machine learning\\napproach either increases both sensitivity and specificity or may only increase one, leave the\\nother unchanged. The geometric mean of both sensitivity and specificity and their average\\nhave been used to compare both models (MBFA and SVM). SVM enhances these values by 8%\\nand 11%, respectively. Improvements might be explained by 2 factors. Firstly, the capacity of\\ngeneralisation of a machine learning method in comparison to the 2 thresholds based MBFA\\nmethod. Secondly, is the inclusion of several features, which better characterise the episodes\\nand the non-episodic movements. Since the database was constructed from data collected in\\nreal environments, situations that are more reflective of real conditions could be used in order\\nto strengthen the classifier against false positives, achieving much better specificities. However,\\nthe algorithm needs some optimisation in order to be implemented in a microcontroller of a\\nwearable device for real-time applications. The most relevant issue is the number of support\\nvectors, which should be reduced as shown in the Evaluation of the proposed algorithm section.\\nThis reduction would lower the computational burden.\\nResults obtained provide a sensitivity and specificity geometric mean of 84% in the person-\\nalised model and of 76% in the generic model, which are significant enough to evaluate FoG at\\npatients’ home. These results have been obtained under challenging conditions, at patients’\\nhome and with a rigorous evaluation process in order to balance the number of true positives\\nand true negatives.\\nAs far as authors know, this algorithm is the first to achieve high sensitivities and specifici-\\nties considering an online implementation using a balanced assessment per episode through\\npatients’ home training, which included a false positive test. This algorithm opens up the possi-\\nbility to rigorously assess FoG in PD patients in real time with the aim of acting quickly with\\nsome cueing modalities [8,74]. Additionally, given that medication considerably affects FoG\\nfrequency and severity in some patients [63], this algorithm could help to accurately tailor\\nmedication regimes in future.\\nAcknowledgments\\nPart of this project has been performed within the framework of the MASPARK project which\\nis funded by La Fundacio´ La Marato´ de TV3 20140431.

We investigated fully automatic coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring and\\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) risk categorization from CT attenuation correction (CTAC)\\nacquired at rest and stress during cardiac PET/CT and compared it with manual annotations in\\nCTAC and with dedicated calcium scoring CT (CSCT).\\nMethods and Results.

In CTAC, CAC was scored automatically using a previously\\ndeveloped machine learning algorithm. Patients were assigned to a CVD risk category based on\\ntheir Agatston score (0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, >400). Agreement in CVD risk categorization\\nbetween manual and automatic scoring in CTAC at rest and stress resulted in Cohen’s linearly\\nweighted j of 0.85 and 0.89, respectively.

However, PET is not able to\\nvisualize atherosclerotic plaque, and hence, it does not allow\\ndetection of subclinical CAD.1 The coronary artery calcium\\n(CAC) burden determined in calcium scoring CT (CSCT),\\nquantiﬁed as the CAC score, is a strong and independent\\npredictor of cardiovascular events (CVE)2 and adds prog-\\nnostic and diagnostic information to an MPI scan.1 Previous\\nstudies suggest that CT attenuation correction (CTAC)\\nimages that are acquired as a part of PET/CT or SPECT/CT\\nmay potentially enable the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\\nof atherosclerotic calciﬁcations in the coronary arteries, and\\nthereby allow improved assessment of CVE risk.3,4 If the\\nCTAC component of the cardiac MPI could be used for\\ncalcium scoring and thereby for the improved evaluation of\\nCVE risk and improved diagnosis,1 the acquisition of a\\ndedicated CSCT scan could be omitted, reducing ionizing\\nradiation dose for the patients, shorteningthe studytime,and\\nsimplifying the procedure. However, CTAC images are not\\nacquired using an optimized protocol for calcium scoring.\\nExcessive motion artifacts, low image resolution, and high\\nlevels of image noise make manual calcium scoring in\\nCTAC a tedious task. Hence, an automatic method would be\\nadvantageous in clinical routine. In this work, we investigate\\nthe utility of a novel method for fully automatic calcium\\nscoring applied to CTAC images. The method is speciﬁcally\\noptimized to score CAC in rest and stress CTAC images that\\nare acquired as part of cardiac PET/CT MPI exams.\\nAdditionally, we compare cardiovascular (CVD) risk cate-\\ngorization obtained from dedicated CSCT scans with\\nmanual and automatic CAC scoring in CTAC images.\\nMETHODS\\nPatients\\nThe study included consecutive 133 patients (85 men, 48\\nwomen, average age 69, age range 31-97) undergoing 82Rb\\nPET/CT and dedicated CSCT scanning at Cedars-Sinai Med-\\nical Center. Table 1 lists patients’ demographic and clinical\\ndata. All patients provided written informed consent for the use\\nof their clinical and imaging data for research purposes, and\\nthe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.\\nImaging Protocols\\nPET. All patients underwent rest and stress gated 82Rb\\nPET MPI and CSCT imaging on a hybrid Biograph 64 PET/CT\\nscanner.5 A 6-minute rest acquisition started immediately before\\nthe injection of 925-1850 MBq (25-50 mCi) of 82Rb. Pharma-\\ncological stress was induced using intravenous adenosine\\ninfusion6 or using a regadenoson bolus.7 No adjunctive exercise\\nwas performed. A 6-minute stress acquisition started immedi-\\nately with the injection of 925-1850 MBq (25-50 mCi) of 82Rb.\\nCTAC. Separate CTAC scans were acquired immedi-\\nately after stress and rest emission PET studies, without\\nmoving the patient from the scan table. The CTAC parameters\\nwere 100 kVp, pitch 1.5, 11 mAs, duration 3.4 seconds, 3 mm\\nslice thickness, end-expiration breath hold.\\nCSCT. After completion of PET MPI, without moving\\npatients from the scan table, CSCT scan was acquired. CSCT\\nscans (120 kVp, 11 mAs, 3 mm slice thickness and increment,\\nECG-triggering) consisted of 30 to 40 slices encompassing the\\nheart from the carina to the apex, with a 30-35 cm ﬁeld of view\\nsufﬁcient to include the entire heart as well as the ascending\\nand descending thoracic aortas.\\nManual Calcium Scoring\\nIn CSCT scans, CAC scoring was performed as part of\\nclinical routine using dedicated CT vendor software (SciI-\\nmage, California US). This software applies a standard 130\\nHounsﬁeld unit (HU) threshold for calciﬁcation extraction. For\\neach patient, the Agatston score was computed. Subjects were\\nassigned to a CVD risk category based on the Agatston score\\n(0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, [400).8,9\\nIn CTAC scans, CAC scoring was performed by an\\nexperienced observer using dedicated in-house developed\\nsoftware9 using a standard 130 HU threshold. To minimize\\nthe effect of intraobserver variability, CTAC scans of each\\npatient acquired at rest and stress were scored consecutively.\\nThe observer was blinded to CAC annotations in CSCT scans.\\nIn CTAC scans, number of lesions, Agatston, and volume\\ncalcium scores were computed.10\\nAutomatic Calcium Scoring from\\nAttenuation Maps\\nCoronary calciﬁcations were identiﬁed using our previ-\\nously developed algorithm for automatic CAC scoring from\\nTable 1.

Given that CTAC scans are obtained for attenuation\\ncorrection and are made using suboptimal image acquisition\\nsettings for calcium scoring, scans are affected by substantial\\nimage noise, artifacts caused by cardiac motion due to lack of\\nECG synchronization, and partial volume effect caused by the\\nlarge in-plane resolution. Hence, for this work, the algorithm\\nwas speciﬁcally optimized for CTAC images.\\nThe algorithm ﬁrst identiﬁes potential CAC lesions in the\\nimage by intensity-based thresholding and 3D connected-\\ncomponent labeling, thus following the standard clinical\\nprocedure. Single voxel lesions are removed from further\\nanalysis as they cannot be differentiated from the noise.\\nSubsequently, each potential calciﬁed lesion is characterized\\nby a number of features, such as volume, shape, intensity and\\nlocation. Shape features are calculated as ratios of eigenvalues\\nfound using a principal component analysis on the location of\\nthe voxels within each candidate. Intensity features are\\ncomputed using the intensity value statistics of each lesion\\nand Gaussian ﬁlters at different resolutions. Location features\\ndescribe the spatial position of each candidate using an\\nestimate of the location of the coronary artery tree, which is\\nacquired using multi-atlas based segmentation. Once features\\nfor all potential CAC lesions have been computed, a two-class\\nclassiﬁer separates CAC and negative lesions such as calciﬁ-\\ncations in the aorta, bones, or noise. The classiﬁer consists of\\nan ensemble of 250 extremely randomized decision trees\\n(Extra-Trees).9,12\\nTenfold cross-validation experiments were performed by\\ndividing the CTAC data into training sets containing 90% of\\nthe images and test sets containing the remaining 10% of\\nimages. Tenfold cross-validation allows strict per patient\\nseparation of training and test data and maximizes the amount\\nof training data. For each candidate lesion, the algorithm\\ndetermined the probability that it was CAC and labeled it as\\neither CAC or background. The identiﬁed CAC was quantiﬁed\\nusing the same procedure as in manual scoring.\\nValidation\\nTo evaluate whether automatic CAC scoring applied to\\nCTAC images is feasible, the CAC scores obtained manually\\nand automatically were compared. This analysis was per-\\nformed separately for CTAC images acquired during rest and\\nstress.\\nTo evaluate whether CAC scoring in CSCT images could\\nbe substituted by CAC scoring in CTAC scans, manual and\\nautomatic CAC scores determined in CTAC images were\\ncompared with CAC scores determined in CSCT scans.\\nStatistical Analysis\\nTo evaluate the performance of automatic CAC scoring in\\nCTAC scans, per patient sensitivity and a number of false\\npositives using the number of lesions and their volume were\\ndetermined. The reliability of the Agatston scores was\\ndetermined by the two-way mixed intraclass correlation\\ncoefﬁcient (ICC) for absolute agreement between manual\\nand automatic scores in CTAC images. In addition, we\\ncompared CAC scores in CSCT with manual and automatic\\nCAC scores in CTAC images. The analyses were performed\\nseparately for CTAC scans acquired at rest and stress.\\nFurthermore, we evaluated whether there was a difference\\nbetween Agatston scores derived from CTAC images acquired\\nat rest and at stress, with either manual or automatic scoring,\\nby Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Bonferroni correction was\\napplied to correct for multiple pairwise comparisons, so that\\nthe level of signiﬁcance was set to 0.0083.\\nTo evaluate accuracy and agreement of CVD risk\\ncategorization between automatic and manual CAC scoring\\nin CTAC scans, patients were assigned to one of the standard\\nﬁve CVD risk categories (0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, [400).8 It\\nis likely that for patients scanned with two different CT\\nsettings, obtained CAC scores may differ but the ranking of the\\npatient scores remains the same. Therefore, we compared CVD\\nrisk categorization between CTAC and CSCT images by ﬁrst\\ndetermining the number of patients assigned to each CVD risk\\ngroup according to the Agatston scores in CSCT scans.\\nSubsequently, the Agatston scores obtained in CTAC scans\\nwere ranked, and we assigned the same number of patients to\\neach group as determined by their ranking with respect to the\\nCSCT categorization.13 The analysis was performed separately\\nfor CTAC scans at rest and stress, and separately for manual\\nand automatic scoring in these images.\\nThe accuracy of CVD risk categorization was determined\\nas a percentage of scans in which two methods agree. The\\nproportion of agreement beyond chance between CVD risk\\ncategory assignments was determined using Cohen’s linearly\\nweighted j. Comparisons between kappa values and accuracies\\nwere performed by Z-score test. Statistical analysis was\\nperformed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 23. Armonk,\\nNY: IBM Corp.). Cohen’s j was computed using VassarStats\\nanalysis (http://vassarstats.net/kappa.html).\\nRESULTS\\nAutomatic vs Manual Calcium Scoring in\\nCTAC Scans\\nFive patients were excluded due to high levels of\\nimage noise4 and artifacts caused by metal implants1\\npreventing manual CAC scoring.\\nIn\\nrest\\nCTAC\\nscans,\\nthe\\nalgorithm\\ncorrectly\\ndetected 68.5% CAC lesions and 76.4% CAC volume\\nper scan, with on average 0.3 false positive lesions\\ncorresponding to 25 mm3 false positive volume per\\nscan.

Figure 1 shows manu-\\nally vs automatically determined CAC scores in CTAC\\nimages at rest and stress.\\nThe results demonstrate that the automatic method\\ncan detect calciﬁcations in CTAC scans in the presence\\nof metal implants and in scans that are strongly affected\\nby cardiac motion (Figure 2). Nevertheless, inspection\\nof the automatic results in CTAC scans revealed several\\noutliers. The automatic method occasionally missed\\nlarge CAC lesions affected by cardiac motion or partial\\nvolume effect resulting in low contrast with the sur-\\nrounding tissue (Figure 3a). This led to underestimation\\nof the CVD risk. Similarly, the automatic method\\noccasionally incorrectly detected noise voxels or calci-\\nﬁcations in the aorta at the coronary ostia, leading to\\noverestimation of the CVD risk (Figure 3b). False\\nnegative lesions were often larger than false positives,\\nleading to more frequent under- than overestimation of\\nthe CAC burden and consequently of the CVD risk\\ncategory (14% vs 3% at rest; 9% vs 3% at stress). False\\nnegative and false positive lesions were similar in\\nCTAC images at rest and stress.

Figure 4 shows CAC scores\\ndetermined manually in references CSCT images vs\\nautomatically obtained CAC scores in CTAC at rest and\\nstress. There was a signiﬁcant difference between Agatston\\nscores in CSCT and Agatston scores in CTAC (P � .01).\\nThis was the case for CTAC scans acquired at rest and\\nstress as well as for automatic and manual CAC scoring.\\nHowever, there was no signiﬁcant difference between\\nmanual Agatston scores in CTAC at rest and CTAC at\\nstress (P = .678), nor between automatic Agatston scores\\nin CTAC at rest and CTAC at stress (P = .281).\\nAgreements in CVD risk categorization between\\nmanual expert scoring in dedicated CSCT scans with\\nmanual and automatic scoring in CTAC scans during\\nrest and during stress are shown in Tables 3 and 4. The\\ncorresponding accuracies and linearly weighted j values\\nare listed in Table 5, indicating good to excellent\\nagreement of both manual and automatic scoring.\\nEven though results demonstrate that manual expert\\nCAC scoring in CTAC tends to slightly better agree with\\nexpert scoring in CSCT than automatic CAC scoring in\\nCTAC scans, visual inspection of the images suggests\\nthat differences in image characteristics between CSCT\\nand CTAC scans have a stronger inﬂuence on the CAC\\nscores than false positive and false negative errors made\\nby the automatic algorithm. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate\\ndifferences between the image characteristics and their\\nimpact on the visualization of CAC lesions.\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis study evaluated both manual and automatic\\ncoronary calcium scoring in CTAC images acquired\\nduring PET/CT scanning. In addition, the obtained CAC\\nscores in CTAC images were compared with manual\\nexpert CAC scores in CSCT scans to evaluate the\\npotential of CAC scoring in CTAC images and thereby\\nassess the possibility of using CTAC maps alone for\\ncardiac risk assessment. A comparison of manual and\\nautomatic CAC scoring in CTAC images showed that\\nthe vast majority ([83%) of patients could be assigned\\nto the correct CVD risk category based on automatic risk\\nassessment.\\nCompared with manual CAC scores in CTAC\\nimages, automatic scoring in images at stress tends to\\nresult in slightly better performance than automatic\\nscoring in images at rest (ICC: 0.884 and 0.828, and j\\n0.89 and 0.85 in stress and rest, respectively). Visual\\ninspection of the images did not reveal obvious causes.\\nHowever, it appeared that errors were similar in both\\nscans suggesting that combining the automatic results\\nfrom both images would not lead to a better agreement\\nbetween the scores in CTAC and CSCT scans. Note that\\nthere was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between\\nthe manual CAC scores in CTAC at rest and at stress,\\nnor between the automatic CAC scores in CTAC at rest\\nand stress.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, very few studies have\\ninvestigated quantitative CAC scoring from standard\\nCTAC scans obtained in PET or SPECT3,4,14. In a\\nmulticenter study including 492 patients, Einstein et al.3\\nFigure 2.

In comparison with a study\\nby Einstein et al., we evaluated the CAC scoring\\nseparately for rest and stress CTAC scans and also\\nevaluated the performance of the automated method. In\\ntwo other recent studies, Mylonas et al.4 and Kaster\\net al.14 scored calcium using the manual identiﬁcation of\\ncoronary calciﬁcations, while we evaluated fully auto-\\nmatic quantiﬁcation in CTAC scans. On a set of 91\\npatients, Mylonas et al.4 reported an ICC of 0.804\\nbetween manually obtained Agatston scores in CSCT\\nand CTAC during rest using a 130 HU threshold for\\nCAC scoring. In the current study, in a set of 128\\npatients, this agreement was 0.863 and 0.866 for rest and\\nstress, respectively. This difference might have been\\nFigure 3.

First, in our study, CTAC and\\nCSCT scans were made on the same day, without\\nmoving the patient off the table, while in Mylonas et al.4\\nthe scans were acquired within 6 months’ time interval.\\nEven though changes in calcium burden within this\\nperiod are unlikely, they might have occurred. However,\\nit is more likely that interscan variability, additionally\\ncaused by different patient positioning on the table,\\nmight have had a larger inﬂuence on the CAC scores.\\nSecond, Mylonas et al.4 evaluated agreement between\\nmanual scoring in CTAC images vs CSCT using\\ndifferent threshold levels and obtained best results using\\nan intensity value threshold of 50 HU with ICC of 0.953.\\nMoreover, Kaster et al.14 reported the best agreement\\nusing an 110 HU threshold. However, in the set of\\nimages used in our study, CAC scoring using an 110 and\\n50 HU threshold level did not allow separation of\\ncalciﬁcations from the background. Using such low\\nthresholds frequently connected CAC lesions with bony\\nstructures.

In dedicated CSCT scans, ﬁve (Agat-\\nston scores 0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400, [400)8 or four\\n(Agatston scores 0, 1-100, 101-300, [300) risk cate-\\ngories are typically used.2 Previous studies investigating\\nCAC scoring in CSCT4,14 deﬁned four risk groups (0, 1-\\n100, 101-400, [400). In this work, categorization of\\npatients in ﬁve risk groups was evaluated to allow\\ndifferentiation between zero and positive score patients,\\nas well as differentiation between low and intermediate\\nCVD risk patients.\\nClinically, it is of key importance to distinguish\\npatients without any calcium and those with positive\\nscores. Thirteen patients had a zero calcium score on\\ndedicated CSCT scan. Manual calcium scoring in CTAC\\nscans at rest and stress identiﬁed 12 and 13 of those 13\\npatients, respectively. However, 5 and 7 additional\\npatients were assigned to the very low CVD risk in scans\\nat rest and stress, respectively. Automatic calcium\\nscoring identiﬁed 13 and 11 of the 13 zero score\\npatients but assigned 11 and 9 additional patients to the\\nvery low CVD risk group in CTAC at rest and stress,\\nrespectively. This demonstrates that CTAC images\\nunderestimate CVD risk even when expert manual\\nannotations are performed. This might be due to high\\nlevels of image noise, cardiac motion artifacts, and\\nespecially partial volume effects, but further research is\\nneeded to reveal the causes.\\nComparison of CAC scores between CTAC and\\nCSCT scans is hampered by differences in image\\nacquisition. Due to low in-plane resolution in CTAC\\ncompared with CSCT scans (*1.35 vs *0.35 mm),\\ndifferent tube voltages (100 vs 120 kVp) and lack of\\nECG gating on CTAC images, we can hardly expect to\\nobtain the same CAC scores in CTAC and CSCT. The\\nresults demonstrated that CAC scores in CTAC images\\nwere signiﬁcantly lower than the CAC scores in CSCT,\\nboth when CTAC images were scored manually and\\nautomatically. To compensate for differences in image\\nacquisition parameters, a previous study corrected the\\nscores obtained in coronary CT angiography scans by\\ndetermining a multiplication factor to convert Agatston\\nscores in coronary CT angiography to Agatston scores in\\nCSCT.15 However, this factor depends on the data at\\nhand and the assumption that the relationship between\\nthe scores is linear. Hence, we compensated for these\\ndifferences by ranking the CAC scores in CTAC scans,\\nas we can assume that CSCT provides the reference risk\\ncategory and that ranking of the CVD risk among the\\npatients remains the same regardless of the image\\nacquisition technique.13\\nThis study has several limitations. First, calcium\\nscoring in CTAC images was compared with clinically\\nacquired scores in CSCT scans by different observers. In\\naddition, during scoring of CTAC images, CSCT scans\\nwere not available for review. This allowed independent\\nscoring but it also likely introduced inter-observer\\nvariabilities thereby hampering exclusive evaluation of\\nthe automatic scoring. Separate scoring of CTAC and\\nCSCT scans have resulted in a decreased agreement\\nbetween both manual and automatic scores in CTAC\\nwith the scores in CSCT. Second, correspondence\\nbetween calciﬁcations in all available scans of the same\\npatient was not analyzed. Due to differences in image\\nacquisition, speciﬁcally partial volume effect and car-\\ndiac motion, this would have been very challenging.\\nConsequently, only patient-based analysis was per-\\nformed. However, this is in agreement with clinical\\nanalysis and previous studies.4,16,17 Third, CSCT scans\\nwere scored using scanner vendor software, while CAC\\nscoring in CTAC images was performed using custom\\nsoftware. This might have caused differences in CAC\\nquantiﬁcation. Nevertheless, we expect that the dis-\\nagreement caused by CAC quantiﬁcation software is\\nminor. Fourth, the speed of the automatic scoring\\nalgorithm was not at all optimized as it was imple-\\nmented within the research environment. It is likely that\\nTable 5.

patients. Large scale adoption of Elec-\\ntronic Health Records (EHR) has created the opportunity to proactively identify patients with\\nhigh risk of hospital readmission, and apply effective interventions to mitigate that risk. To\\nthat end, in the past, numerous machine-learning models have been employed to predict\\nthe risk of 30-day hospital readmission. However, the need for an accurate and real-time\\npredictive model, suitable for hospital setting applications still exists. Here, using data from\\nmore than 300,000 hospital stays in California from Sutter Health’s EHR system, we built\\nand tested an artificial neural network (NN) model based on Google’s TensorFlow library.\\nThrough comparison with other traditional and non-traditional models, we demonstrated\\nthat neural networks are great candidates to capture the complexity and interdependency of\\nvarious data fields in EHRs. LACE, the current industry standard, showed a precision (PPV)\\nof 0.20 in identifying high-risk patients in our database. In contrast, our NN model yielded a\\nPPV of 0.24, which is a 20% improvement over LACE. Additionally, we discussed the pre-\\ndictive power of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data, and presented a simple cost\\nanalysis to assist hospitalists in implementing helpful and cost-effective post-discharge\\ninterventions.\\nIntroduction\\nSince the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law in 2010, hospital readmission rates\\nhave received increasing attention as both a metric for the quality of care and a savings\\nopportunity for the American healthcare system [1]. Per American Hospital Association, the\\nnational readmission rate finally fell to 17.5% in 2013 after holding at approximately 19% for\\nseveral years [2]. Hospital readmissions cost more than $17 billion annually [3]. According to\\nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC), 76% of hospital readmissions are\\npotentially avoidable [4].\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181173\\nJuly 14, 2017\\n1 / 14\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\na1111111111\\nOPEN ACCESS\\nCitation: Jamei M, Nisnevich A, Wetchler E, Sudat\\nS, Liu E (2017) Predicting all-cause risk of 30-day\\nhospital readmission using artificial neural\\nnetworks.

Through an internal review board\\nprocess (SH IRB # 2015.084EXP RDD), Sutter\\nHealth provided Bayes Impact with its patients\\nanonymized electronic medical records.

These penalties should be put in\\nthe context of a larger shift in healthcare from the current fee-for-service payment model to a\\nmore patient-centered value-based payment model. Formation of Accountable Care Organiza-\\ntions (ACO) and CMS’ Quality Payment Program are examples of this trend that has created\\nfinancial incentives for hospitals and care providers to address the readmission problem more\\nsystematically.\\nBefore establishing targeted intervention programs, it is important to first identify those\\npatients with a high risk of readmission. Fortunately, the widespread adoption of EHR systems\\nhas produced a vast amount of data that could help predict patients’ risk of future readmis-\\nsions. Numerous attempts to build such predictive models have been made [6–12]. However,\\nthe majority of them suffer from at least one of the following shortcomings: (1) the model is\\nnot predictive enough compared to LACE [11], the industry-standard scoring model [13], (2)\\nthe model uses insurance claim data, which would not be available in a real-time clinical set-\\nting [6,7], (3) the model does not consider social determinants of health (SDoH) [13,8], which\\nhave proven to be predictive [14], (4) the model is limited to a particular medical condition,\\nand thus, limited in scope [9,10].\\nTo address these shortcomings, we built a model to predict all-cause 30-day readmission\\nrisk, and added block-level census data as proxies for social determinants of health. Addition-\\nally, instead of using insurance claims data, which could take up to a month to process, we\\nbuilt our model on the data available during the inpatient stay or at the time of discharge. Gen-\\nerally, using real-time EHR data allows models to be employed in hospital setting applications.\\nParticularly, the authors are interested in applications of this predictive model in supporting\\ndata-driven post-discharge interventions to mitigate the risk of hospital readmission.\\nMethods\\nEthics\\nThis study was conducted using health record data (without patient names) taken from 20 hos-\\npitals across Sutter Health, a large nonprofit hospital network serving Northern California.\\nThe Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Sutter Health (SH IRB # 2015.084EXP RDD)\\napproved the study.\\nData preparation\\nElectronic health records corresponding to 323,813 inpatient stays were extracted from Sutter\\nHealth’s EPIC electronic record system. Table 1 shows a summary of the population under\\nstudy. We had access to all Sutter EHR data, beginning in 2009 and going through the end of\\n2015. Since many hospitals only recently completed their EHR integration, some 80% of the\\ndata comes from 2013–2015 (Fig 1). To ensure data consistency, we limited our hospitals of\\nstudy to those with over 3,000 inpatient records and excluded Skilled Nursing and other spe-\\ncialty facilities. Fig 2 shows the total number of records for each hospital, and their respective\\nreadmission rates.\\nWe studied all inpatient visits to all Sutter hospitals. Hospital transfers and elective admis-\\nsions were excluded. With this method, a 30-day boolean readmission label was created for\\neach hospital admission.\\nIn the current version of their EHR system, Sutter Health captures a few SDoH data fields,\\nsuch as history of alcohol and tobacco use.

In each case, a 5-fold cross validation, with\\n20% of the data kept hidden from the model, was performed. We found that the neural net-\\nwork models heavily outperformed other models in performance and recall, with the neural\\nnetwork model being about 10 times faster to train than the random forest model, the second\\nbest performing model. Therefore, we focused on optimizing the neural network model.\\nAfter evaluating a variety of neural network architectures, we found the best-performing\\nmodel to be a two-layer neural network, containing one dense hidden layer with half the size\\nof the input layer, and dropout nodes between all layers to prevent overfitting. Our model\\narchitecture can be seen in Fig 3. To train the neural network, we used the keras framework\\n[20] on top of Google’s TensorFlow [21] algorithm. We trained in batches of 64 samples using\\nthe Adam optimizer [22], limiting our training to 5 epochs because we found that any further\\ntraining tended to result in overfitting, as indicated by validation accuracy decreasing with\\neach epoch while training loss continued to improve.\\nInitially, we trained the model on 1667 features extracted from the dataset. We then\\nretrained the model using the top N features most correlated with 30-day readmission, for dif-\\nferent values of N. As shown in Fig 4, the model achieved over 95% of the optimal precision\\nwhen limited to the top 100 features, suggesting that 100 features is a reasonable cutoff for\\nachieving near-optimal performance at a fraction of the training time and model size required\\nfor the full model. Table 3 summarizes the features most correlated with readmission risk.\\nMeasuring a model’s performance cannot be completely separated from its intended use.\\nWhile one metric, AUC, is designed to measure model behavior across the full range of possi-\\nble uses, in practice risk models are only ever used to flag a minority patient population, and\\nso the statistic is not fully relevant. Metrics like precision and recall require a yes/no interven-\\ntion threshold before they can even be computed, something that we lack as this model is\\nnot slated for a specific clinical program. For simplification, we assumed the model would be\\nused in an intervention on the 25% of patients with the highest predicted risk. We chose 25%\\nbecause this is the fraction of patients that LACE naturally flags as high-risk, so we conserva-\\ntively compare to LACE on its best terms. Additionally, we wanted to understand the predic-\\ntive power of each set of features. To achieve that, we removed individual feature sets, one at a\\ntime, and compared the performance (in terms of AUC) with the best performing model.\\nProviders often want to focus their interventions on a specific patient population based on\\ntheir age, geography or medical condition. Therefore, it is important to measure how well the\\nmodel performs in each of those subpopulations. In addition, so far, CMS has penalized hospi-\\ntals for excessive readmission of patients with heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmo-\\nnary disease (COPD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia5. We compared the\\nperformance of our model against LACE in each of those subpopulations.\\nCost savings analysis\\nThe main objective of this research study is to build and pilot a predictive model to accurately\\nidentify high-risk patients, and support the implementation of valuable and cost-effective\\npost-discharge interventions. Therefore, a cost-saving analysis could assist decision makers to\\neffectively plan and optimize hospital resources.\\nPredicting hospital readmission with neural networks\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181173\\nJuly 14, 2017\\n6 / 14\\nThe optimal intervention threshold for maximizing cost savings depends on (1) the average\\ncost of a readmission, (2) the expected cost of intervention(s), and (3) the expected effective-\\nness of intervention(s). Then, we can calculate the expected savings from each given interven-\\ntion strategy as follows:\\nSavings\\n¼\\nExpected Benefits � Costs\\n¼\\nð# Correctly � Chosen InterventionsÞ � ðIntervention Success RateÞ\\n�ðReadmission CostÞ � ð# Total InterventionsÞ � ðIntervention CostÞ\\nFig 3.

This nonlinear nature of ANNs enables us to harness more pre-\\ndicitive power from the additional extracted EHR data fields beyond LACE’s four parameters.\\nFurthermore, neural networks are compact and can be incrementally retrained on new data\\nto avoid the “model drift” that occurs when a model trained on data too far back in the past\\nperforms progressively worse on future data that follows a different pattern.\\nThe TensorFlow framework provides several added benefits for training a readmission\\nmodel. First, TensorFlow can run in a variety of environments, whether on CPUs, GPUs, or\\ndistributed clusters. This means that the same kind of model can be trained in a variety of dif-\\nferent hospital IT architectures, and achieve optimal performance in each. Secondly, with the\\naid of high-level interfaces, such as keras, TensorFlow can model neural network architectures\\nin a very natural way. This enabled us to quickly experiment with different neural network set-\\nups to find the ideal configuration for the problem. Finally, TensorFlow is an actively main-\\ntained open-source project, and its performance improves continually through contributions\\nfrom the open-source machine-learning community.\\nA fair comparison of our model with results in existing literature is not feasible, because the\\nperformance of readmission risk models varies tremendously between different patient popu-\\nlations, and no previous readmission prediction work has been done on the Sutter Health\\npatient population. Even the LACE model’s performance varies in the literature from 0.596\\nAUC [10] to 0.684 AUC [11], which illustrates the impact of patient population on the accu-\\nracy of readmission prediction.\\nThe performance of our model (as measured by precision, recall, and AUC) within patient\\nsubgroups tends to be worse than the performance of the same model within the whole patient\\npopulation. Some of this performance drop can be explained by the fact that each subgroup\\nrepresents a reduced feature set to our model—for example, age is no longer as predictive a\\nfeature to when every patient in a subgroup has a similar age. Furthermore, our model tends to\\nperform on subgroups that LACE also has the worst performance on, such as patients aged 85\\n+ (Fig 5) or patients with heart failure (Fig 7), suggesting that certain patient subpopulations\\nhave significantly less predictable readmission patterns than the general patient population.\\nWe used two sources of SDoH features: health history questions (regarding tobacco, alco-\\nhol, and drug use) and block-level census data based on patient address. The health history fea-\\ntures had some predictive value, two of them (“no alcohol use” and “quit smoking”) being in\\nthe top 100 features most linearly correlated with readmission risk. However, the census fea-\\ntures were less predictive, with no features in the top 100 and only a few in the top 200 (such as\\npoverty rate and household income). Both feature sources suffered from drawbacks: the health\\nsurveys were both brief and incomplete for ~25% of patients, while the block-level census data\\nonly provided information about a patient’s neighborhood but not about the patient them-\\nselves. For SDoH features to provide significant predictive value, they would have to be both\\ncomprehensive and individualized.\\nSince this study was conducted on EHR data from Sutter Health network of hospitals in\\nCalifornia, it does not capture potential out-of-network hospital readmissions. To address this\\nlimitation, the dataset could be supplemented by state or national index hospital admissions to\\nbuild a more comprehensive dataset.\\nConclusions\\nIn this study, we successfully trained and tested a neural network model to predict the risk of\\npatients’ rehospitalization within 30 days of their discharge. This model has several advantages\\nover LACE, the current industry standard, and other proposed models in the literature\\nPredicting hospital readmission with neural networks\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181173\\nJuly 14, 2017\\n12 / 14\\nincluding (1) significantly better performance in predicting the readmission risk, (2) being\\nbased on real-time data from EHR, and thus applicable at the time discharge from hospital,\\nand (3) being compact and immune to model drift. Furthermore, to determine the classifier’s\\nlabeling threshold, we suggested a simple cost-saving optimization analysis.\\nFurther research is required to study the effect of more granular and structured social deter-\\nminants of health data on the model’s predictive power. Some studies [23] have shown that\\nnatural language processing (NLP) techniques could be used to extract SDoH data from\\npatient’s case notes. However, the most systematic method is to gather such data from SDoH\\nscreeners. Currently, multiple initiatives [24] are underway to standardize SDoH screeners,\\nand integrate them into EHR systems.\\nThe importance of reducing hospital readmissions, and therefore risk assessment, is likely\\nto only grow in importance in the years to come. We believe that predictive analytics in gen-\\neral, and modern machine-learning techniques in particular, are powerful tools that have to be\\nfully exploited in this field.\\nSoftware release\\nThe neural network model described in the paper, as well as the code to run it on EMR data, is\\navailable (under the Apache license) at https://github.com/bayesimpact/readmission-risk.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) for supporting\\nthis research study.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of Bayesian\\nnetworks for biomechanical modeling using a static biomechanical model of spinal forces during lifting. A 20-node Bayesian\\nnetwork model was used to implement a well-established static two-dimensional biomechanical model for predicting L5/S1\\ncompression and shear forces. The model was also implemented as a Monte Carlo simulation in MATLAB. Mean L5/S1 spinal\\ncompression force estimates diﬀered by 0.8%, and shear force estimates were the same. The model was extended to incorporate\\nevidence about disc injury, which can modify the prior probability estimates to provide posterior probability estimates of spinal\\ncompression force. An example showed that changing disc injury status from false to true increased the estimate of mean L5/S1\\ncompression force by 14.7%. This work shows that Bayesian networks can be used to implement a whole-body biomechanical\\nmodel used in occupational biomechanics and incorporate disc injury.\\n1. Introduction\\nStochastic\\nmodeling\\nhas\\nbecome\\na\\nuseful\\nanalytical\\nmethod in biomechanics over the last twenty years.\\nApplications have included lumbar region muscle forces\\n[1], musculoskeletal injury risk prediction [2–4], upper\\nextremity joint mechanics [5–8] muscle modeling [9],\\npopulation\\nmorphological\\nmodeling\\n[10],\\nprobabilistic\\nsensitivity analyses [11], tissue repair [12], and orthopae-\\ndic implant design [13, 14]. Past stochastic biomechani-\\ncal models use Monte Carlo simulation, advanced mean\\nvalue theorem, or Markov chain models. Unfortunately,\\nthese methods are all “forward” simulation methods that\\nproduce probability estimates of outcomes based on model\\ninputs represented as random variables.\\nBayesian networks are well established in artiﬁcial intelli-\\ngence [15, 16], risk analysis [17], and reliability engineering\\n[18–21] and have the potential to enhance biomechanical\\nmodeling. A Bayesian network is a graphical probabilistic\\nmodel containing nodes and directed edges that can be used\\nto compute probabilities when evidence has been entered at a\\nvariety of nodes in the graph, some of which are descendants\\nof the primary variable of interest [22]. Consider the problem\\nof predicting lumbar spine compression force during lifting,\\nwhich is a common task in occupational biomechanics. Exist-\\ning biomechanical models require task-related inputs like\\nmass in the hands, anthropometry, and joint angles to predict\\ncompression force [23, 24]. Physiologically driven models\\nalso require electromyographic measurements [25–28]. The\\nresults of these models are predictions of spinal compression\\nand shear forces. In theory, a Bayesian network could be used\\nto also incorporate intervertebral disc injury status, which\\nexisting models cannot.\\nTherefore, the purpose of this project was to evaluate\\nthe feasibility of implementing a well-established static\\ntwo-dimensional biomechanical model of lifting as a\\nHindawi\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\nVolume 2017, Article ID 2014961, 7 pages\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2014961\\nBayesian network and extend it to include disc prolapse as a\\nmodel input.\\n2. Methods\\nThe design of this study consisted of ﬁve steps: (1) implement\\na well-established deterministic static two-dimensional bio-\\nmechanical model for predicting L5/S1 shear and compres-\\nsion force as a Bayesian network, (2) extend the Bayesian\\nnetwork to include uncertainty in model inputs, (3) verify\\nthe implementation, (4) augment model to include disc\\ninjury status, and (5) evaluate eﬀect of including disc injury\\nstatus on L5/S1 compression force estimates.\\nA well-established deterministic model for predicting L5/\\nS1 compression force during lifting was selected as the basis\\nfor this model [29] (pp. 130-131). This model computes\\nintersegmental reaction forces and moments at the elbow,\\nshoulder, and L5/S1 disc. Body segment lengths and masses\\nare scaled from status and total body mass, respectively.\\nThe location of the center of mass for each segment is scaled\\nto segment length. All necessary body segment anthropomet-\\nric parameters are described in Chaﬃn et al. [29] (pp. 41–47).\\nThe model allows for a downward directed hand force repre-\\nsenting the holding of an object in the hands. The model is\\nbilaterally symmetric. A 50th-percentile female (161.8 cm\\nstature and 65.6 kg body mass) was used for all simulations.\\nThe erector spinae moment arm was 5.3 cm according to\\nChaﬃn et al.’s recommendation for models not incorporat-\\ning intra-abdominal pressure (p. 134).\\nThe deterministic and stochastic versions of the lifting\\nmodel were also coded in MATLAB R2014a (The Math-\\nworks, Natick, MA) for purposes of validation. Monte Carlo\\nsimulation was used for the stochastic simulation, and each\\nsimulation contained 107 iterations. Hand calculations were\\nalso performed for selected deterministic cases for code\\nveriﬁcation.\\nThe next step was to implement the same model as a\\nBayesian network [30] using AgenaRisk software (Agena,\\nCambridge, UK). A Bayesian network is a graphical probabi-\\nlistic modeling framework developed initially in artiﬁcial\\nintelligence [15, 16]. A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic\\ngraph in which the directed edges represent conditional\\nindependence assumptions and node probability tables\\nare associated with each node. Each node represents a ran-\\ndom variable. The probability table associated with a node\\nconsists of a full statement of conditional probabilities for\\nall nodes that are parents of the node. It is also possible to\\ncode deterministic relationships between nodes. Probability\\ndistributions can be deﬁned for nodes, as well as observed\\nvalues of the random variables. Junction tree methods are\\nused to propagate probability distributions through the\\nnetwork [31].\\nIn the Bayesian network implementation of the lifting\\nmodel, nodes for input data were deﬁned: mass in hands,\\nelbow angle, shoulder angle, torso angle, knee angle, and ankle\\nangle (Figure 1). Note that in this paper, variables are indi-\\ncated in italics. Intermediate nodes were also deﬁned for pur-\\nposes of computation. Nodes were introduced for the\\nreaction forces and moments at the elbow (elbow reaction\\nforce and elbow reaction moment), shoulder (shoulder reac-\\ntion force and shoulder reaction moment), and L5/S1 level\\n(L5/S1 reaction force and L5/S1 reaction moment). A node\\nwas created for the erector spinae moment arm, and another\\nfor erector spine force. The eﬀect if intra-abdominal pressure\\nwas excluded because of the nonlinearity of the relationship\\nbetween hip moment and pressure (p. 132). A node for\\nL5/S1 disc angle was included, as were three nodes (β, T,\\nand K) to implement a regression model for predicting devi-\\nation of disc angle from 40 degrees [32], which is how Chaﬃn\\net al. compute disc angle (p. 132). Two output nodes were\\ndeﬁned: (1) L5/S1 compression force and (2) L5/S1 shear force.\\nEdges were introduced to link the nodes in a way that repre-\\nsented mechanics. In AgenaRisk, each arc was given the\\ndeterministic relationships linking nodes. This deﬁned the\\ndeterministic version of the lifting model.\\nThe model was extended to a stochastic model by modi-\\nfying the input nodes to be normally distributed random var-\\niables rather than deterministic values. Liu et al. [33] showed\\nthat assessment of body segment angles for a lifting model\\nusing common ergonomics tools has measurement error\\nand these error estimates were used to deﬁne the standard\\ndeviation for each joint angle. Since Liu et al. [33] reported\\nmean absolute errors, normality was assumed and the result\\nof Geary [34] was used to compute standard deviation for\\nthe elbow, shoulder, and torso angles. The standard deviation\\nfor the error across all joints was also computed, and this was\\nused for the knee and ankle.\\nThe method was evaluated on a lifting task obtained from\\na study of heavy work that has been previously reported [35].\\nThe task involved lifting chunks of carbon that had broken\\noﬀ large anodes in an aluminum smelter. Posture was col-\\nlected from video of the job taken from a single viewpoint.\\nThe postural measurements were subject to error as shown\\nby Liu et al. [33], and hand load was random because\\nthe carbon pieces broke oﬀ from anodes by a process that\\ncreated a wide distribution of masses. Therefore, both pos-\\nture and hand load were modeled as normally distributed\\nrandom variables. Table 1 provides the mean (and stan-\\ndard deviation) joint angles. The mass of the object in\\nthe hands was modeled as a normally distributed random\\nvariable having mean and standard deviation of 53.1 kg\\nand 12.8 kg, respectively.\\nA modiﬁed model was developed that incorporates\\nintervertebral disc prolapse status (a so-called “injury-\\naugmented” model). It is the full DAG shown in Figure 1.\\nIt was developed by adding a probabilistic inference model\\nof structural failure in which failure occurs when the applied\\nload exceeds the compressive strength. Both applied load\\nand strength were modeled as random variables [36].\\nTherefore, a node for intervertebral disc compressive\\nstrength was added. The distribution of compressive strength\\nwas assumed to be normally distributed. The mean (5448 N)\\nand standard deviation (2366 N) values were taken from\\nreports of cadaver testing [37]. A disc prolapse Boolean\\nvariable node was added that took on a true value if and only\\nif the compression force exceeded the disc compressive\\nstrength. For the numerical example analyzed to illustrate\\nthe method, separate simulations were performed for three\\n2\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\nMass in\\nhands\\nTorso angle\\nShoulder angle\\nElbow angle\\nL5/S1 reaction\\nmoment\\nShoulder reaction\\nmoment\\nElbow reaction\\nmoment\\nElbow reaction\\nforce\\nShoulder reaction\\nforce\\nL5/S1 reaction\\nforce\\nErector spinae\\nforce\\nErector spinae\\nmoment arm\\nT\\nK\\n\u0001훽\\nKnee angle\\nAnkle angle\\nL5/S1 shear force\\nL5/S1 compression\\nforce\\nL5/S1 disc \\nangle\\nDisc compression\\nstrength\\nDisc injury\\nFigure 1: Bayesian network implementation of a two-dimensional top-down lifting model described by Chaﬃn et al. [29] (pp. 130–134). The\\n“basic model” is the DAG outside the dashed rectangle at the bottom; the “injury-augmented model” is the entire DAG including the two\\nnodes and edges inside the dashed rectangle at the bottom. Input variables are represented as gray nodes (mass in hands, elbow angle,\\nshoulder angle, torso angle, knee angle, and ankle angle). The angles are deﬁned relative to the horizontal. Intermediate angles T (torso\\nangle from vertical) and K (included knee angle) are computed from input angles to reduce the complexity of the expression in β, which\\nwas the deviation of the disc angle from 40°. This was done to facilitate computation. Joint reaction forces and moments are calculated for\\nthe elbow, shoulder, and L5/S1 levels because it is a top-down modeling approach. The line of action of the erector spinae muscle is\\nassumed to be perpendicular to the L5/S1 disc, so there is no directed edge from erector spinae force to L5/S1 shear force. The erector\\nspinae moment arm is treated as a constant (5.3 cm) and has its own node. The variables to be predicted in this model are the L5/S1\\ncompression force and L5/S1 shear force, and they are denoted as blue nodes. The injury-augmented model was created by adding the\\nnodes contained in the dashed rectangle (disc injury and disc compression strength); these implement the inference model of disc\\nfailure based on structural reliability modeling. Because the disc injury node was an input in the injury-augmented model, its node\\nis shaded gray.\\n3\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\ninjury conditions: (1) no disc injury evidence entered, (2)\\ndisc injury Boolean variable set to false, and (3) disc injury\\nBoolean variable set to true. The model also included\\nmodeling postures and hand loads as random variables\\nas described above.\\n3. Results\\nThe deterministic model implemented as a Bayesian network\\nproduced L5/S1 compression force estimates that were\\nwithin 1.4 N (0.04%) of the MATLAB implementation\\npredictions (Table 2). Similarly, both deterministic model\\nversions produced the same L5/S1 shear force estimate. This\\ndemonstrates veriﬁcation of the deterministic implementa-\\ntion. The Bayesian network basic model in which the joint\\nangles were modeled as random variables produced greater\\naverage L5/S1 compression force than the MATLAB imple-\\nmentation. However, the diﬀerence in means was only\\n28.5 N (0.8%). When hand load was simulated as a random\\nvariable, the diﬀerence in means was only 3.8 N (0.1%). For\\nthe random posture case, the 25th percentile, median, and\\n75th percentile of the compression force distribution were\\nwithin 290.2 N (4.5%), 1.6 N (0.05%), and 261.9 N (7.0%) of\\nthe MATLAB code Monte Carlo implementation results.\\nThe injury-augmented model’s predicted L5/S1 compres-\\nsion force changed as evidence was entered at the injury node.\\nWhen evidence of no injury (disc injury = false) was entered\\nat the injury node, the mean compression force was\\n3190.2 N (SD 789.3). However, when evidence of injury (disc\\ninjury = true) was entered, the predicted mean compression\\nforce increased to 3660.9 N (SD 820.0). This was an increase\\nof 470.7 N (14.7%). Moreover, the injury evidence shifted the\\nentire distribution. The 25th percentile value went from\\n2664.1 N to 3095.9 N when disc injury was changed from\\nfalse to true; the 75th percentile similarly increased from\\n3690.1 N to 4180.1 N going from false to true. Predicted\\nmean L5/S1 shear force also changed from 673.1 N (SD\\n108.9) to 715.7 N (SD 111.0) when disc injury was changed\\nfrom false to true.\\n4. Discussion\\nThis project demonstrated the ability of implementing a bio-\\nmechanical force prediction as a Bayesian network. The error\\nbetween mean L5/S1 compression force estimates was small\\n(<1%), and it was lower when modeling hand load as a ran-\\ndom variable than when modeling joint angles as random\\nvariables. While Bayesian networks have had limited use in\\nbiomechanical data analysis, they have not been used to\\nimplement whole-body biomechanical models.\\nA Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\\nwhose nodes encode conditional probability statements\\nand edges reﬂect conditional independence assumptions.\\nDirected edges can be thought of as indicating causal rela-\\ntionships [38]. Directed paths in the DAG can also represent\\ncausal structures. In the ﬁrst model developed (Figure 1), a\\nDAG is constructed so that directed paths go from input var-\\niables (mass in hands, elbow angle, etc.) and internal struc-\\ntural variables (erector spinae moment arm, L5/S1 disc\\nangle, etc.) to low back kinetic variables (L5/S1 shear force\\nand L5/S1 compression force). This “basic model,” which\\nmerely implements the standard model of Chaﬃn, is the\\nDAG shown outside of the dashed rectangle in Figure 1. Cal-\\nculations on this network are straightforward and do not\\nrequire Bayes’ theorem. However, the full power of a Bayes-\\nian network is apparent when Bayes’ theorem is used to cal-\\nculate probabilities backwards along directed paths. The\\ninjury-augmented model (entire network in Figure 1) does\\nthis. Moreover, the injury-augmented model uses both the\\ninput data required for the basic model (Figure 1) and disc\\nprolapse status (disc injury node in Figure 1 denoting the\\nBoolean variable describing whether the person being ana-\\nlyzed has a prolapsed disc or not). The diﬀerence was\\n14.7%, which demonstrates the impact incorporating disc\\ninjury status can have on spinal compression force estimates.\\nAnother interesting feature of calculations performed on\\na Bayesian network is how the disc injury variable aﬀects L5/\\nS1 shear force. Note that the disc injury node is a descendant\\nof the L5/S1 shear force node, yet changing disc injury from\\nfalse to true increases the mean L5/S1 shear force from\\n673.1 N to 715.7 N. If it is a descendant, how can it aﬀect\\nL5/S1 shear force? It is because there is—in terminology from\\ngraphical causal modeling—a “trek” from disc injury to\\nL5/S1 shear force that does not contain a collider node\\n[39]. Changing the value of disc injury from false to true\\naﬀects L5/S1 reaction force through L5/S1 compression force\\nbecause of Bayes’ theorem. In turn, L5/S1 reaction force\\naﬀects L5/S1 shear force. A similar eﬀect could occur via the\\nL5/S1 disc angle node.\\nExisting stochastic simulation methods are forward\\nmethods that propagate probability from distributions of\\ninput parameters to distributions of outputs. Previously,\\nMonte Carlo simulation has been the most common tool\\nfor introducing probabilistic elements into deterministic bio-\\nmechanical models [1–4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 40]. While intuitively\\neasy to implement, Monte Carlo techniques are computa-\\ntionally intensive. Laz et al. [14] introduced the use of the\\nadvanced mean value theorem approach to probabilistic sim-\\nulation in biomechanics. Markov chain models have also\\nbeen used for stochastic modeling of soft-tissue failure [12].\\nIn Bayesian network parlance, all of these methods place\\nthe input variables on nodes that are ancestors of the variable\\nto be predicted. Variables that are graph-theoretic descen-\\ndants of the predicted variable cannot inﬂuence the predic-\\ntions. This makes it impossible to include injury status into\\nthe calculation of spinal compression and shear forces using\\nexisting probabilistic methods.\\nTable 1: Model input posture parameters.\\nJoint\\nAngle from horizontal\\n(degrees)\\nStandard deviation\\n(degrees)\\nAnkle\\n82\\n9.4\\nKnee\\n114\\n9.4\\nTorso\\n40\\n6.3\\nShoulder\\n192\\n7.9\\nElbow\\n−56\\n11.8\\n4\\nApplied Bionics and Biomechanics\\nThe most signiﬁcant limitation of the Bayesian net-\\nwork implementation of the model was the diﬃculty in\\npredicting the tails of the spinal compression force distri-\\nbution. Speciﬁcally, there was a diﬀerence of 7% for the\\n75th percentile. An additional limitation was that the\\nBayesian network produced a better estimate of the mean\\ncompression force when the hand load was modeled as a\\nrandom variable than when the joint angles were random.\\nThis is because the eﬀect of joint angles on spinal com-\\npression force is nonlinear.\\nComparisons of these results to other Bayesian network\\nmodels in biomechanics are diﬃcult because so few applica-\\ntions of Bayesian networks exist in biomechanics. Van Gestel\\net al. [41] and Lo et al. [42] used a Bayesian network for gait\\nclassiﬁcation, but neither used the Bayesian network to\\nimplement a biomechanical model. Ma et al. [43] used a\\nBayesian network to analyze spinal kinematics in patients\\nhaving low bone mineral density. Again, no biomechanical\\nmodel was used. Bayesian networks have also been used in\\nthe analysis of clinical data related to degenerative disease\\nof the lumbar spine. Takenaka and Aono [44] used a Bayes-\\nian network to develop a classiﬁer for lower extremity muscle\\nstrength for patients presenting with drop foot following\\nlumbar spinal decompression surgery.\\nA diﬀerent comparison to existing literature can be\\nmade by noting the similarity to work done in the struc-\\ntural reliability area. The model developed here considers\\ndisc prolapse to occur when the applied load exceeds the\\ncompressive strength of the intervertebral disc to withstand\\nload [36]. In this context, the current model can be viewed\\nas using a stochastic biomechanical model to predict the load\\nand cadaver testing to provide strength data. Thus, there is a\\nconceptual connection to work implementing interference\\nmodels in structural reliability models using Bayesian net-\\nworks [45]. Donnell et al. [12] have also used the interference\\nmodel of structural failure in biomechanics, although not\\nimplemented as a Bayesian network.\\nThis model takes a simplistic view of spinal injury\\nmechanics to highlight the Bayesian network modeling tech-\\nnique; future work should include subtle factors. The disc\\ncompression limit came from a study [37] that tested spinal\\nmotion segments in mild ﬂexion, matching the lifting posture\\nsimulated. However, it used a single load to failure test para-\\ndigm, where other authors argue that cyclic loading is a very\\nimportant factor in intervertebral disc failure [46, 47]. The\\ncurrent model also only considered compression in disc\\ninjury; the eﬀects of shear should also be investigated [48].\\nIn conclusion, this is a novel contribution to low back\\nmodeling because heretofore, biomechanical models pre-\\ndicted spinal compression force from posture and hand load\\nwithout consideration of disc injury status. It is Bayes’ theo-\\nrem that allows for disc injury, which is a graph-theoretic\\ndescendant of L5/S1 compression force on the causal directed\\npath, to inﬂuence the estimate of L5/S1 compression force.\\nThis innovation may be useful in areas such as litigation,\\nfor example, where the analysis is being done to estimate\\nwhether compression force exceeds a recommended thresh-\\nold for a speciﬁc person who has experienced a prolapsed\\nintervertebral disc.\\nConflicts of Interest\\nThere are no competing interests.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the Department of Orthopaedic\\nSurgery of the University of Michigan.\\nReferences\\n[1] G.
